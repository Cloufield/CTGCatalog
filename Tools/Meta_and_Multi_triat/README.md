## METAL 
- SHORT NAME: METAL
- FULL NAME: METAL
- YEAR: 2012
- DESCRIPTION: METAL is a tool for meta-analysis genomewide association scans. METAL can combine either (a) test statistics and standard errors or (b) p-values across studies (taking sample size and direction of effect into account). METAL analysis is a convenient alternative to a direct analysis of merged data from multiple studies. It is especially appropriate when data from the individual studies cannot be analyzed together because of differences in ethnicity, phenotype distribution, gender or constraints in sharing of individual level data imposed. Meta-analysis results in little or no loss of efficiency compared to analysis of a combined dataset including data from all individual studies.

## MR-MEGA 
- SHORT NAME: MR-MEGA
- FULL NAME: Meta-Regression of Multi-AncEstry Genetic Association
- YEAR: 2017
- DESCRIPTION: MR-MEGA (Meta-Regression of Multi-AncEstry Genetic Association) is a tool to detect and fine-map complex trait association signals via multi-ancestry meta-regression.  This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007].  Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates.  The flexibility of this model enables partitioning of the heterogeneity into components due to ancestry and residual variation, which would be expected to improve fine-mapping resolution.

- DESCRIPTION: MetaSTAAR is an R package for performing Meta-analysis of variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (MetaSTAAR) procedure in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. MetaSTAAR enables functionally-informed rare variant meta-analysis of large WGS studies using an efficient, sparse matrix approach for storing summary statistic, while protecting data privacy of study participants and avoiding sharing subject-level data. MetaSTAAR accounts for relatedness and population structure of continuous and dichotomous traits, and boosts the power of rare variant meta-analysis by incorporating multiple variant functional annotations.
