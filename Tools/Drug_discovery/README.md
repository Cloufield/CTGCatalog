## DRUG TARGETOR
- FULL NAME:DRUG TARGETOR
- SHORT NAME:DRUG TARGETOR
- YEAR: 2019
- DESCRIPTION: This website harnesses results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and drug bioactivity data, to prioritize drugs and targets for a given phenotype. Drug Targetor networks are constructed using genetically scored drugs and genes, connected by the type of drug-target or drug-gene interaction
