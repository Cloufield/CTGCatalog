## DRUG TARGETOR
- FULL NAME:DRUG TARGETOR
- SHORT NAME:DRUG TARGETOR
- YEAR: 2019
- DESCRIPTION: This website harnesses results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and drug bioactivity data, to prioritize drugs and targets for a given phenotype. Drug Targetor networks are constructed using genetically scored drugs and genes, connected by the type of drug-target or drug-gene interaction

## GREP
- SHORT NAME: GREP
- FULL NAME:Genome for REPositioning drugs
- YEAR: 2019
- DESCRIPTION: GREP can quantify an enrichment of the user-defined set of genes in the target of clinical indication categories and capture potentially repositionable drugs targeting the gene set. Both can be run in a few seconds!

## Open Targets Genetics
- FULL NAME:Open Targets Genetics
- SHORT NAME:Open Targets Genetics
- YEAR: 2021
- DESCRIPTION: Open Targets Genetics is a comprehensive tool highlighting variant-centric statistical evidence to allow both prioritisation of candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci and identification of potential drug targets.

## Priority index
- FULL NAME:Priority index
- SHORT NAME:Priority index
- YEAR: 2019
- DESCRIPTION: A Comprehensive Resource for Genetic Targets in Immune-Mediated Disease
- URL: http://pi.well.ox.ac.uk:3010/
- CITATION:Fang, H., De Wolf, H., Knezevic, B., Burnham, K. L., Osgood, J., Sanniti, A., ... & Knight, J. C. (2019). A genetics-led approach defines the drug target landscape of 30 immune-related traits. Nature genetics, 51(7), 1082-1091.

## Trans-Phar
- FULL NAME:integration of Transcriptome-wide association study and Pharmacological database
- SHORT NAME:Trans-Phar 
- YEAR: 2021
- DESCRIPTION: This software achieves in silico screening of chemical compounds, which have inverse effects in expression profiles compared with genetically regulated gene expression of common diseases, from large-scale pharmacological database (Connectivity Map [CMap] L1000 library).
- URL: https://github.com/konumat/Trans-Phar
- CITATION: Konuma, T., Ogawa, K., & Okada, Y. (2021). Integration of genetically regulated gene expression and pharmacological library provides therapeutic drug candidates. Human Molecular Genetics, 30(3-4), 294-304.
- Hypothesis: "Compounds, which have inverse effects in gene expression profiles when compared with GREx from common diseases, could be detected as potential drug candidates that are effective for disease treatment"

## PS4DR
- FULL NAME:Pathway Signatures for Drug Repositioning
- SHORT NAME:PS4DR
- YEAR: 2020
- DESCRIPTION: This package comprises a modular workflow designed to identify drug repositioning candidates using multi-omics data sets. A schematic figure of the workflow is presented below. The R scripts necessary to run the MSDRP pipeline are located in the R directory.

## PES
- FULL NAME:Pharmagenic_enrichment_score
- SHORT NAME: PES
- YEAR: 2020
- DESCRIPTION: a framework to quantify an individual’s common variant enrichment in clinically actionable systems responsive to existing drugs.
- CITATION: Reay, W. R., Atkins, J. R., Carr, V. J., Green, M. J., & Cairns, M. J. (2020). Pharmacological enrichment of polygenic risk for precision medicine in complex disorders. Scientific reports, 10(1), 1-12.
