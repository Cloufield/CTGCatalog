- SHORT NAME:simGWAS
- FULL NAME:simGWAS
- YEAR:2019

- URL: https://github.com/chr1swallace/simGWAS
- CITATION:Fortune, Mary D., and Chris Wallace. "simGWAS: a fast method for simulation of large scale case–control GWAS summary statistics." Bioinformatics 35.11 (2019): 1901-1906.

## HAPGEN2
- SHORT NAME:HAPGEN2
- FULL NAME:HAPGEN2
- YEAR:2011
- DESCRIPTION:HAPGEN2 is a an updated version of the program HAPGEN, which simulates case control datasets at SNP markers. The new version can now simulate multiple disease SNPs on a single chromosome, on the assumption that each disease SNP acts independently and are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We also supply a R package that can simulate interaction between the disease SNPs.
