## PoPs
- SHORT NAME: PoPs
- FULLNAME: gene-level Polygenic Priority Score (PoPS)
- DESCRIPTION:PoPS is a gene prioritization method that leverages genome-wide signal from GWAS summary statistics and incorporates data from an extensive set of public bulk and single-cell expression datasets, curated biological pathways, and predicted protein-protein interactions.

## DEPICT
- SHORT NAME:DEPICT
- FULLNAME:  Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits 
- DESCRIPTION: an integrative tool that employs predicted gene functions to systematically prioritize the most likely causal genes at associated loci, highlight enriched pathways and identify tissues/cell types where genes from associated loci are highly expressed. DEPICT is not limited to genes with established functions and prioritizes relevant gene sets for many phenotypes.
