## ANNOVAR
- SHORT NAME: ANNOVAR
- FULL NAME: Annotate Variation
- DESCRIPTION: ANNOVAR is an efficient software tool to utilize update-to-date information to functionally annotate genetic variants detected from diverse genomes (including human genome hg18, hg19, hg38, as well as mouse, worm, fly, yeast and many others).
