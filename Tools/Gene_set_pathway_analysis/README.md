## MAGMA
- SHORT NAME: MAGMA
- FULL NAME: Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation
- YEAR : 2015
- DESCRIPTION:MAGMA is a tool for gene analysis and generalized gene-set analysis of GWAS data. It can be used to analyse both raw genotype data as well as summary SNP p-values from a previous GWAS or meta-analysis.

## FUMA
- FULL NAME:FUMA
- SHORT NAME:FUMA
- YEAR:2017
- DESCRIPTION:FUMA is a platform that can be used to annotate, prioritize, visualize and interpret GWAS results.

## PASCAL
- FULL NAME:Pathway scoring algorithm
- SHORT NAME:PASCAL
- YEAR:2016

## VEGAS2
- FULL NAME:Versatile Gene-based Association Study - 2 version 2
- SHORT NAME:VEGAS2
- YEAR:2015
- DESCRIPTION:This is the VEGAS2 web platform. Here, user can perfome the gene-based and pathway-based analyses on GWAS summary data using VEGAS and VEGAS2Pathway approaches respectively. It is publically available for non-commercial use.
