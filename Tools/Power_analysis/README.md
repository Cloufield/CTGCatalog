## GAS Power Calculator
- SHORT NAME: GAS Power Calculator
- FULL NAME: Genetic Association Study Power Calculator
- DESCRIPTION: This Genetic Association Study (GAS) Power Calculator is a simple interface that can be used to compute statistical power for large one-stage genetic association studies. The underlying method is derived from the CaTS power calculator for two-stage association studies (2006).
