- SHORT NAME : Matrix eQTL
- FULL NAME : Matrix eQTL
- URL: http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/
- DESCRIPTION : Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large datasets. Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype and gene expression using linear regression with either additive or ANOVA genotype effects. The models can include covariates to account for factors as population stratification, gender, and clinical variables. It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, false discovery rate estimation and separate treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.

## FastQTL 
- SHORT NAME : FastQTL
- FULL NAME : FastQTL
- URL: https://github.com/francois-a/fastqtl
- DESCRIPTION : In order to discover quantitative trait loci (QTLs), multi-dimensional genomic datasets combining DNA-seq and ChiP-/RNA-seq require methods that rapidly correlate tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes with millions of genetic variants while appropriately controlling for multiple testing. FastQTL implements a popular cis-QTL mapping strategy in a user- and cluster-friendly tool. FastQTL also proposes an efficient permutation procedure to control for multiple testing.
