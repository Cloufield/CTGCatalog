- SHORT NAME: THISTLE
- FULL NAME:testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects
- DESCRIPTION:THISTLE (testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects) is a transcript-based splicing QTL (sQTL) mapping method that uses either individual-level genotype and RNA-seq data or summary-level isoform-eQTL data.

## sQTLseekeR
- SHORT NAME: sQTLseekeR
- FULL NAME: sQTLseekeR
- DESCRIPTION:sQTLseekeR is a R package to detect splicing QTLs (sQTLs), which are variants associated with change in the splicing pattern of a gene. Here, splicing patterns are modeled by the relative expression of the transcripts of a gene.

## LeafCutter
- SHORT NAME: LeafCutter
- FULL NAME:LeafCutter
- DESCRIPTION: Leafcutter quantifies RNA splicing variation using short-read RNA-seq data. The core idea is to leverage spliced reads (reads that span an intron) to quantify (differential) intron usage across samples.
