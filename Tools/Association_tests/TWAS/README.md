## FUSION
- FULL NAME: Functional Summary-based Imputation
- SHORT NAME: FUSION
- YEAR: 2016
- DESRIPTION:FUSION is a suite of tools for performing transcriptome-wide and regulome-wide association studies (TWAS and RWAS). FUSION builds predictive models of the genetic component of a functional/molecular phenotype and predicts and tests that component for association with disease using GWAS summary statistics. The goal is to identify associations between a GWAS phenotype and a functional phenotype that was only measured in reference data. We provide precomputed predictive models from multiple studies to facilitate this analysis.

- SHORT NAME:  PrediXcan
- YEAR: 2015
- DESRIPTION: PrediXcan is a gene-based association test that prioritizes genes that are likely to be causal for the phenotype.

## MultiXcan
- FULL NAME: MultiXcan
- SHORT NAME:  MultiXcan
- YEAR: 2018
- DESRIPTION: an efficient statistical method (MultiXcan) that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. MultiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure.

## TWAS hub
- FULL NAME:TWAS hub
- SHORT NAME:TWAS hub
- YEAR:2018
- DESRIPTION:TWAS hub is an interactive browser of results from integrative analyses of GWAS and functional data for hundreds of traits and >100k expression models. The aim is facilitate the investigation of individual TWAS associations; pleiotropic disease/trait associations for a given gene of interest; predicted gene associations for a given disease/trait of interest with detailed per-locus statistics; and pleiotropic relationships between traits based on shared associated genes.
