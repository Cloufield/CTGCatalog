## FUSION
- FULL NAME: Functional Summary-based Imputation
- SHORT NAME: FUSION
- YEAR: 2016
- DESRIPTION:FUSION is a suite of tools for performing transcriptome-wide and regulome-wide association studies (TWAS and RWAS). FUSION builds predictive models of the genetic component of a functional/molecular phenotype and predicts and tests that component for association with disease using GWAS summary statistics. The goal is to identify associations between a GWAS phenotype and a functional phenotype that was only measured in reference data. We provide precomputed predictive models from multiple studies to facilitate this analysis.

## TWAS hub
- FULL NAME:TWAS hub
- SHORT NAME:TWAS hub
- YEAR:2018
- DESRIPTION:TWAS hub is an interactive browser of results from integrative analyses of GWAS and functional data for hundreds of traits and >100k expression models. The aim is facilitate the investigation of individual TWAS associations; pleiotropic disease/trait associations for a given gene of interest; predicted gene associations for a given disease/trait of interest with detailed per-locus statistics; and pleiotropic relationships between traits based on shared associated genes.
