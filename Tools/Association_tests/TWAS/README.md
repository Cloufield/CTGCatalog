- DESRIPTION:FUSION is a suite of tools for performing transcriptome-wide and regulome-wide association studies (TWAS and RWAS). FUSION builds predictive models of the genetic component of a functional/molecular phenotype and predicts and tests that component for association with disease using GWAS summary statistics. The goal is to identify associations between a GWAS phenotype and a functional phenotype that was only measured in reference data. We provide precomputed predictive models from multiple studies to facilitate this analysis.
