## STAAR
- FULLNAME: variant-set test for association using annotation information
- SHORTNAME: STAAR
- URL: https://github.com/xihaoli/STAAR
- DESCRIPTION: STAAR is an R package for performing variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) procedure in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. STAAR is a general framework that incorporates both qualitative functional categories and quantitative complementary functional annotations using an omnibus multi-dimensional weighting scheme. STAAR accounts for population structure and relatedness, and is scalable for analyzing large WGS studies of continuous and dichotomous traits.

- KEY WORDS: functional annotations


## SKAT
- FULLNAME: sequence kernel association test
- SHORTNAME: SKAT
- URL:  https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/skat/
- DESCRIPTION: SKAT is a SNP-set (e.g., a gene or a region) level test for association between a set of rare (or common) variants and dichotomous or quantitative phenotypes, SKAT aggregates individual score test statistics of SNPs in a SNP set  and efficiently computes SNP-set level p-values, e.g. a gene or a region level p-value, while adjusting for covariates, such as principal components to account for population stratification. SKAT also allows for power/sample size calculations for designing for sequence association studies.

- KEY WORDS: 

## SKAT-O
- FULLNAME: sequence kernel association test - optimal test
- SHORTNAME: SKAT-O
- URL:https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/skat/
- DESCRIPTION: estimating the correlation parameter in the kernel matrix to maximize the power, which corresponds to the estimated weight in the linear combination of the burden test and SKAT test statistics that maximizes power.
