# Single variant association tests
## PLINK  
- FULLNAME: PLINK
- SHORTNAME: PLINK
- DESCRIPTION: A Tool Set for Whole-Genome Association and Population-Based Linkage Analyses. PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent visualization, annotation and storage of results.

## EMMAX
- FULLNAME:efficient mixed-model association eXpedited
- SHORTNAME:EMMAX
- URL: https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/EMMAX
- DESCRIPTION: EMMAX is a statistical test for large scale human or model organism association mapping accounting for the sample structure. In addition to the computational efficiency obtained by EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes advantage of the fact that each loci explains only a small fraction of complex traits, which allows us to avoid repetitive variance component estimation procedure, resulting in a significant amount of increase in computational time of association mapping using mixed model.

## GEMMA
- FULLNAME: genome-wide efficient mixed-model association 
- SHORTNAME: GEMMA
- DESCRIPTION: GEMMA is the software implementing the Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithm for a standard linear mixed model and some of its close relatives for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It fits a standard linear mixed model (LMM) to account for population stratification and sample structure for single marker association tests. It fits a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes explained (PVE) by typed genotypes (i.e. chip heritability), predicting phenotypes, and identifying associated markers by jointly modeling all markers while controlling for population structure. It is computationally efficient for large scale GWAS and uses freely available open-source numerical libraries.

SAIGE performs single-variant association tests for binary traits and quantitative taits. For binary traits, SAIGE uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA)(mhof, J. P. , 1961; Kuonen, D. 1999; Dey, R. et.al 2017) to account for case-control imbalance.
