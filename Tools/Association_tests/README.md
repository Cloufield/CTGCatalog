## STAAR
- FULLNAME: variant-set test for association using annotation information
- SHORTNAME: STAAR
- URL: https://github.com/xihaoli/STAAR
- DESCRIPTION: STAAR is an R package for performing variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) procedure in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. STAAR is a general framework that incorporates both qualitative functional categories and quantitative complementary functional annotations using an omnibus multi-dimensional weighting scheme. STAAR accounts for population structure and relatedness, and is scalable for analyzing large WGS studies of continuous and dichotomous traits.
