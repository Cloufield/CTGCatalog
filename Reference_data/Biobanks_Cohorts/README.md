- DESCRIPTION:Genomic studies in African populations provide unique opportunities to understand disease aetiology, human genetic diversity and population history in a regional and a global context. To leverage the relative benefits of different strategies, we undertook a combined approach of genotyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a population-based study of 6,400 individuals from a geographically defined rural community in South-West Uganda. We present data from 4,778 individuals with genotypes for ~2.2 million SNPs from the Uganda GWAS resource (UGWAS), and sequence data on up to 1,978 individuals spanning 41.5M SNPs and 4.5M indels (UG2G); 343 individuals overlap between the two datasets. We highlight the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as a global resource for variant discovery, imputation and understanding the mutational spectrum and its clinical relevance in African populations. Alongside phenotype data, we provide a rich new genomic resource for researchers in Africa and globally

## Penn Medicine Biobank
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~40k
- LOCATION: U.S.
- URL:https://pmbb.med.upenn.edu/
- DESCRIPTION:The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) is a research program created to study the causes and treatments of many diseases. Any Penn Medicine patient (age 18 and up) can sign up. The PMBB is a collection of biological samples, such as blood or tissue, that are donated by patient volunteers. These samples are then connected to clinical information, such as diseases or lab measures. These data are then used by researchers to discover new ways to detect, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure disease. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease. Other studies look at how genes affect response to medicines.
 
## UCLA Precision Health Biobank

## BioMe
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~32k
- LOCATION: U.S.
- URL:https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/ipm/programs/biome-biobank
- DESCRIPTION:The Institute for Personalized Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is leading the movement toward diagnosis and classification of disease according to the patient’s molecular profile. This approach accommodates differences at all possible levels of exposure (genome, environment, and lifestyle) and at all stages of the process, from prevention to post-treatment follow-up. At the center of this effort is BioMe, an electronic medical record-linked biobank that enables researchers to rapidly and efficiently conduct genetic, epidemiologic, molecular, and genomic studies on large collections of research specimens linked with medical information.

## BioVU
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~120k
- LOCATION: U.S.
- URL:https://www.vumc.org/dbmi/biovu
- DESCRIPTION:Planning for BioVU began in mid-2004 and the first samples were collected in February 2007. Prior to collecting DNA samples, all aspects of the BioVU project were extensively tested. BioVU now accrues 500-1000 samples per week, totaling more than 275,000 DNA samples as of January 2022. Vanderbilt clinic patients may sign the BioVU Consent Form if they wish to donate their excess blood samples, or not sign the form if they do not wish to participate.

## Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~34k
- LOCATION: U.S.
- URL:https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/cobiobank
- DESCRIPTION:Established in 2014 as a partnership between UCHealth and University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM) brings together multiple disciplines and institutions to uncover advancements in genomics that can improve diagnosis and treatment of disease, and identify more tailored approaches to population health management.To facilitate discoveries in personalized medicine, CCPM has created a Biobank that aims to be one of the largest academic medicine biospecimen repositories in the mountain and midwest regions of the U.S. The CCPM Biobank is able to link biospecimens and genotype information with patient health information from electronic medical records in an enterprise data warehouse (Health Data Compass) to support a broad range of research, operational, and clinical quality improvement agendas. 

## CanPath - Ontario Health Study
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~7.3k
- LOCATION: Canada
- URL:https://canpath.ca/cohort/ontario-health-study/
- DESCRIPTION:The Ontario Health Study (OHS) is a resource for investigating the ways in which lifestyle, the environment and genetics affect people’s health. It is one of the regional cohorts that collectively form the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow’s Health (CanPath)—a pan-Canadian cohort with >330 000 participants. The linking of Canada’s rich collection of administrative health data with the cohort’s data represents a powerful means to disseminate high-quality, timely data.
