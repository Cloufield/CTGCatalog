## UK Biobank (UKB)
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~500k
- LOCATION: United Kingdom
- URL: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/
- DESCRIPTION: UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health information from half a million UK participants. The database is regularly augmented with additional data and is globally accessible to approved researchers undertaking vital research into the most common and life-threatening diseases. It is a major contributor to the advancement of modern medicine and treatment and has enabled several scientific discoveries that improve human health.

## HUNT
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~88k
- LOCATION: Norway
- URL: https://www.ntnu.edu/hunt/hunt-biobank
- DESCRIPTION:HUNT Biobank is an established and modern research biobank with high-technology equipment for storage, analysis, sample handling and delivery of samples. Our samples satisfy high quality standards and are stored in accordance with the Data Inspectorates laws and regulations. HUNT Biobank engages in sample handling from The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), Cohort of Norway (CONOR), and can receive samples from other researchers and research projects for storage, analysis and processing of DNA. We do not store samples from private individuals.

## Generation Scotland
- SAMPLE SIZE: ~24k
- LOCATION: Scotland
- URL: https://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland
- DESCRIPTION: Generation Scotland is a research study looking at the health and well-being of volunteers and their families. Generation Scotland combines responses to questionnaires of health and well-being from birth through life. We combine this with NHS health records and innovative laboratory science to understand health trajectories. We work closely with researchers and our volunteers to create a rich evidence base for understanding health. Through this rigorous, ethical and safe approach to research, we seek to enable meaningful change in public health.
