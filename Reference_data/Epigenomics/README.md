## Roadmap
- DESCRIPTION: The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium was launched with the goal of producing a public resource of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology and disease-oriented research. The project has generated high-quality, genome-wide maps of several key histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and mRNA expression across 100s of human cell types and tissues.
