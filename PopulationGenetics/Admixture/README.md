- SHORT NAME: ADMIXTURE
- FULL NAME: ADMIXTURE
- YEAR: 2009
- DESCRIPTION: ADMIXTURE is a software tool for maximum likelihood estimation of individual ancestries from multilocus SNP genotype datasets. It uses the same statistical model as STRUCTURE but calculates estimates much more rapidly using a fast numerical optimization algorithm.

## OpenADMIXTURE
- SHORT NAME: OpenADMIXTURE
- FULL NAME: OpenADMIXTURE
- YEAR: 2022
- DESCRIPTION: This software package is an open-source Julia reimplementation of the ADMIXTURE package. It estimates ancestry with maximum-likelihood method for a large SNP genotype datasets, where individuals are assumed to be unrelated.
