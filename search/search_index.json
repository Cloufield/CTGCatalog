To achieve this, we employ a three-step proteome-by-phenome Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach. In step one, 154 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were identified and independently replicated. From these pQTLs, 64 replicated locally-acting variants were used as instrumental variables for proteome-by-phenome MR across 846 traits (step two). When its assumptions are met, proteome-by-phenome MR, is equivalent to simultaneously running many randomized controlled trials. Step 2 yielded 38 proteins that significantly predicted variation in traits and diseases in 509 instances. Step 3 revealed that amongst the 271 instances from GeneAtlas (UK Biobank), 77 showed little evidence of pleiotropy (HEIDI), and 92 evidence of colocalization (eCAVIAR). Results were wide ranging: including, for example, new evidence for a causal role of tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1 (SHPS1; SIRPA) in schizophrenia, and a new finding that intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) abundance contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We also demonstrated confirmatory evidence for the causal role of four further proteins (FGF5, IL6R, LPL, LTA) in cardiovascular disease risk. </li> <li>CITATION : Bretherick AD, Canela-Xandri O, Joshi PK, Clark DW, ...&amp;, Haley C.

However, the functional variants or mechanistic consequences remain elusive. Intermediate traits such as gene expression or protein levels are good proxies of the metabolic state of an organism. Proteome analysis especially can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex traits like obesity. The role of genetic variation in determining protein level variation has not been assessed in obesity. To address this, we design a large-scale protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) analysis based on a set of 1129 proteins from 494 obese subjects before and after a weight loss intervention. This reveals 55 BMI-associated cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs at baseline and 3 trans-pQTLs after the intervention. We provide evidence for distinct genetic mechanisms regulating BMI-associated proteins before and after weight loss. Finally, by functional analysis, we identify and validate FAM46A as a trans regulator for leptin. </li> <li>CITATION : Carayol J, Chabert C, Di Cara A, Armenise C, ...&amp;, Hager J.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (A\u03b242), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with A\u03b242 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (\u03b2 = -0.059, P = 2.08 \u00d7 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (\u03b2 = -0.025, P = 1.72 \u00d7 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 \u00d7 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: \u03b2 = 0.277, P = 1.92 \u00d7 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: \u03b2 = 0.043, P = 4.62 \u00d7 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an A\u03b2-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF A\u03b242 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results. Together the findings from this study can be used to inform future AD studies. </li> <li>CITATION : Deming Y, Li Z, Kapoor M, Harari O, ...&amp;, Cruchaga C.

Here we show the impact of genetic, clinical and lifestyle factors on circulating levels of 92 protein biomarkers for cancer and inflammation, using a population-based cohort of 1,005 individuals. For 75% of the biomarkers, the levels are significantly heritable and genome-wide association studies identifies 16 novel loci and replicate 2 previously known loci with strong effects on one or several of the biomarkers with P-values down to 4.4 \u00d7 10(-58). Integrative analysis attributes as much as 56.3% of the observed variance to non-disease factors.

We integrated pQTL and genetic associations with diseases and other traits and found that 12% of 45,334 lead associations in the GWAS Catalog are with variants in high linkage disequilibrium with pQTL. We identified 938 genes encoding potential drug targets with variants that influence levels of possible biomarkers.

In combination with genotyping, such studies offer the prospect to 1) identify mechanisms involved with regulation of protein expression in plasma, and 2) determine whether the plasma proteins are likely to be causally implicated in disease. We report here the results of genome-wide association (GWA) studies of 83 proteins considered relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD), measured in 3,394 individuals with multiple CVD risk factors. We identified 79 genome-wide significant (p&lt;5e-8) association signals, 55 of which replicated at P&lt;0.0007 in separate validation studies (n = 2,639 individuals). Using automated text mining, manual curation, and network-based methods incorporating information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we propose plausible causal mechanisms for 25 trans-acting loci, including a potential post-translational regulation of stem cell factor by matrix metalloproteinase 9 and receptor-ligand pairs such as RANK-RANK ligand. Using public GWA study data, we further evaluate all 79 loci for their causal effect on coronary artery disease, and highlight several potentially causal associations. Overall, a majority of the plasma proteins studied showed evidence of regulation at the genetic level. Our results enable future studies of the causal architecture of human disease, which in turn should aid discovery of new drug targets. </li> <li>CITATION : Folkersen L, Fauman E, Sabater-Lleal M, Strawbridge RJ, ...&amp;, M\u00e4larstig A.

Here, we map and replicate protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 90 cardiovascular proteins in over 30,000 individuals, resulting in 451 pQTLs for 85 proteins. For each protein, we further perform pathway mapping to obtain trans-pQTL gene and regulatory designations. We substantiate these regulatory findings with orthogonal evidence for trans-pQTLs using mouse knockdown experiments (ABCA1 and TRIB1) and clinical trial results (chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5), with consistent regulation. Finally, we evaluate known drug targets, and suggest new target candidates or repositioning opportunities using Mendelian randomization. This identifies 11 proteins with causal evidence of involvement in human disease that have not previously been targeted, including EGF, IL-16, PAPPA, SPON1, F3, ADM, CASP-8, CHI3L1, CXCL16, GDF15 and MMP-12.

The measurement of protein level variation in solid tissues and biofluids integrated with genetic variants offers a path to deeper functional insights. Here we present a large-scale proteogenomic study in 5,368 individuals, revealing 4,035 independent associations between genetic variants and 2,091 serum proteins, of which 36% are previously unreported. The majority of both cis- and trans-acting genetic signals are unique for a single protein, although our results also highlight numerous highly pleiotropic genetic effects on protein levels and demonstrate that a protein's genetic association profile reflects certain characteristics of the protein, including its location in protein networks, tissue specificity and intolerance to loss of function mutations. Integrating protein measurements with deep phenotyping of the cohort, we observe substantial enrichment of phenotype associations for serum proteins regulated by established GWAS loci, and offer new insights into the interplay between genetics, serum protein levels and complex disease. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Gudjonsson A, Gudmundsdottir V, Axelsson GT, Gudmundsson EF, ...&amp;, Gudnason V.

Therefore, we conduct genome- and epigenome-wide association studies on the levels of 92 neurological proteins to identify genetic and epigenetic loci associated with their plasma concentrations (n = 750 healthy older adults). We identify 41 independent genome-wide significant (P &lt; 5.4 \u00d7 10-10) loci for 33 proteins and 26 epigenome-wide significant (P &lt; 3.9 \u00d7 10-10) sites associated with the levels of 9 proteins. Using this information, we identify biological pathways in which putative neurological biomarkers are implicated (neurological, immunological and extracellular matrix metabolic pathways). We also observe causal relationships (by Mendelian randomisation analysis) between changes in gene expression (DRAXIN, MDGA1 and KYNU), or DNA methylation profiles (MATN3, MDGA1 and NEP), and altered plasma protein levels. Together, this may help inform causal relationships between biomarkers and neurological diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Hillary RF, McCartney DL, Harris SE, Stevenson AJ, ...&amp;, Marioni RE.

Furthermore, association studies between molecular probes and human traits are often performed by linear model-based methods which may fail to account for complex structure and interrelationships within molecular datasets. METHODS: In this study, we perform genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS/EWAS) on the levels of 70 plasma-derived inflammatory protein biomarkers in healthy older adults (Lothian Birth Cohort 1936; n = 876; Olink\u00ae inflammation panel). We employ a Bayesian framework (BayesR+) which can account for issues pertaining to data structure and unknown confounding variables (with sensitivity analyses using ordinary least squares- (OLS) and mixed model-based approaches). RESULTS: We identified 13 SNPs associated with 13 proteins (n = 1 SNP each) concordant across OLS and Bayesian methods. We identified 3 CpG sites spread across 3 proteins (n = 1 CpG each) that were concordant across OLS, mixed-model and Bayesian analyses. Tagged genetic variants accounted for up to 45% of variance in protein levels (for MCP2, 36% of variance alone attributable to 1 polymorphism). Methylation data accounted for up to 46% of variation in protein levels (for CXCL10). Up to 66% of variation in protein levels (for VEGFA) was explained using genetic and epigenetic data combined.

However, the impact of the genetic factors on the human proteome is largely unexplored, mainly due to lack of suitable high-throughput methods. Here we present unique and comprehensive identification of genetic variants affecting the human plasma protein profile by combining high-throughput and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) with genome-wide SNP data. We identified and quantified the abundance of 1,056 tryptic-digested peptides, representing 163 proteins in the plasma of 1,060 individuals from two population-based cohorts. The abundance level of almost one-fifth (19%) of the peptides was found to be heritable, with heritability ranging from 0.08 to 0.43. The levels of 60 peptides from 25 proteins, 15% of the proteins studied, were influenced by cis -acting SNPs. We identified and replicated individual cis -acting SNPs (combined P value ranging from 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u221252 to 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u221212 ) influencing 11 peptides from 5 individual proteins. These SNPs represent both regulatory SNPs and nonsynonymous changes defining well-studied disease alleles such as the \u025b4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which has been shown to increase risk of Alzheimer's disease. Our results show that high-throughput mass spectrometry represents a promising method for large-scale characterization of the human proteome, allowing for both quantification and sequencing of individual proteins. Abundance and peptide composition of a protein plays an important role in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of a number of diseases. A better understanding of the genetic impact on the plasma proteome is therefore important for evaluating potential biomarkers and therapeutic agents for common diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Johansson \u00c5, Enroth S, Palmblad M, Deelder AM, ...&amp;, Gyllensten U.

Previous efforts to characterize the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome have been limited by a focus on individuals of European descent and leveraged genotyping arrays and imputation. Here we describe whole genome sequence analysis of the plasma proteome in individuals with greater African ancestry, increasing our power to identify novel genetic determinants. METHODS: Proteomic profiling of 1301 proteins was performed in 1852 Black adults from the Jackson Heart Study using aptamer-based proteomics (SomaScan). Whole genome sequencing association analysis was ascertained for all variants with minor allele count \u22655. Results were validated using an alternative, antibody-based, proteomic platform (Olink) as well as replicated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the HERITAGE Family Study (Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics). RESULTS: We identify 569 genetic associations between 479 proteins and 438 unique genetic regions at a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 3.8\u00d710-11. These associations include 114 novel locus-protein relationships and an additional 217 novel sentinel variant-protein relationships. Novel cardiovascular findings include new protein associations at the APOE gene locus including ZAP70 (sentinel single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs7412-T, \u03b2=0.61\u00b10.05, P=3.27\u00d710-30) and MMP-3 (\u03b2=-0.60\u00b10.05, P=1.67\u00d710-32), as well as a completely novel pleiotropic locus at the HPX gene, associated with 9 proteins. Further, the associations suggest new mechanisms of genetically mediated cardiovascular disease linked to African ancestry; we identify a novel association between variants linked to APOL1-associated chronic kidney and heart disease and the protein CKAP2 (rs73885319-G, \u03b2=0.34\u00b10.04, P=1.34\u00d710-17) as well as an association between ATTR amyloidosis and RBP4 levels in community-dwelling individuals without heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results provide evidence for the functional importance of variants in non-European populations, and suggest new biological mechanisms for ancestry-specific determinants of lipids, coagulation, and myocardial function. </li> <li>CITATION : Katz DH, Tahir UA, Bick AG, Pampana A, ...&amp;,  and Blood Institute TOPMed (Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine) Consortium\u2020.

Additional CSF analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with study-wide significant p-values (p&lt;1.46\u00d710-10) and significant, consistent evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be relevant to other diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Kauwe JS, Bailey MH, Ridge PG, Perry R, ...&amp;, Goate AM.

Genetic variation may modulate corresponding protein levels and point to the role of these variants in disease pathophysiology. Effects of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a gene were analyzed for corresponding plasma protein levels using genome-wide association study (GWAS) genotype data and proteomic panel data with 132 quality-controlled analytes from 521 Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Linear regression analysis detected 112 significant (Bonferroni threshold p=2.44\u00d710(-5)) associations between 27 analytes and 112 SNPs. 107 out of these 112 associations were tested in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) cohort for replication and 50 associations were replicated at uncorrected p&lt;0.05 in the same direction of effect as those in the ADNI. We identified multiple novel associations including the association of rs7517126 with plasma complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) level at p&lt;1.46\u00d710(-60), accounting for 40 percent of total variation of the protein level. We serendipitously found the association of rs6677604 with the same protein at p&lt;9.29\u00d710(-112). Although these two SNPs were not in the strong linkage disequilibrium, 61 percent of total variation of CFHR1 was accounted for by rs6677604 without additional variation by rs7517126 when both SNPs were tested together. 78 other SNP-protein associations in the ADNI sample exceeded genome-wide significance (5\u00d710(-8)). Our results confirmed previously identified gene-protein associations for interleukin-6 receptor, chemokine CC-4, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensinogen, although the direction of effect was reversed in some cases. This study is among the first analyses of gene-protein product relationships integrating multiplex-panel proteomics and targeted genes extracted from a GWAS array. With intensive searches taking place for proteomic biomarkers for many diseases, the role of genetic variation takes on new importance and should be considered in interpretation of proteomic results. </li> <li>CITATION : Kim S, Swaminathan S, Inlow M, Risacher SL, ...&amp;, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Genome-wide studies have revealed that mRNA levels are associated with genetic variation in or close to the gene coding for those mRNA transcripts - cis effects, and elsewhere in the genome - trans effects. The role of genetic variation in determining protein levels has not been systematically assessed. Using a genome-wide association approach we show that common genetic variation influences levels of clinically relevant proteins in human serum and plasma. We evaluated the role of 496,032 polymorphisms on levels of 42 proteins measured in 1200 fasting individuals from the population based InCHIANTI study. Proteins included insulin, several interleukins, adipokines, chemokines, and liver function markers that are implicated in many common diseases including metabolic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. We identified eight Cis effects, including variants in or near the IL6R (p = 1.8x10(-57)), CCL4L1 (p = 3.9x10(-21)), IL18 (p = 6.8x10(-13)), LPA (p = 4.4x10(-10)), GGT1 (p = 1.5x10(-7)), SHBG (p = 3.1x10(-7)), CRP (p = 6.4x10(-6)) and IL1RN (p = 7.3x10(-6)) genes, all associated with their respective protein products with effect sizes ranging from 0.19 to 0.69 standard deviations per allele. Mechanisms implicated include altered rates of cleavage of bound to unbound soluble receptor (IL6R), altered secretion rates of different sized proteins (LPA), variation in gene copy number (CCL4L1) and altered transcription (GGT1). We identified one novel trans effect that was an association between ABO blood group and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (p = 6.8x10(-40)), but this finding was not present when TNF-alpha was measured using a different assay , or in a second study, suggesting an assay-specific association. Our results show that protein levels share some of the features of the genetics of gene expression. These include the presence of strong genetic effects in cis locations.

Here, we present a fully multivariate proteomic QTL (pQTL) analysis performed with our recently proposed Bayesian method LOCUS on data from two clinical cohorts, with plasma protein levels quantified by mass-spectrometry and aptamer-based assays. Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which &gt;80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several trans and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database. Thanks to its efficient variational Bayes implementation, LOCUS can analyze jointly thousands of traits and millions of markers. Its applicability goes beyond pQTL studies, opening new perspectives for large-scale genome-wide association and QTL analyses.

However, little is known regarding the genetic basis of variation in protein levels of human CSF. We examined CSF levels of 1,126 proteins in 133 subjects and performed a genome-wide association analysis of 514,227 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). To be conservative, Spearman's correlation was used to identify an association between genotypes of SNPs and protein levels. A total of 421 cis and 25 trans SNP-protein pairs were significantly correlated at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01 (nominal P &lt; 7.66 \u00d7 10-9). Cis-only analysis revealed additional 580 SNP-protein pairs with FDR &lt; 0.01 (nominal P &lt; 2.13 \u00d7 10-5). pQTL SNPs were more likely, compared to non-pQTL SNPs, to be a disease/trait-associated variants identified by previous genome-wide association studies. The present findings suggest that genetic variations play an important role in the regulation of protein expression in the CNS.

However, although hundreds of genetic variants have been associated with complex disorders, the underlying molecular pathways often remain elusive. Associations with intermediate traits are key in establishing functional links between GWAS-identified risk-variants and disease end points. Here we describe a GWAS using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform. We quantify 539 associations between protein levels and gene variants (pQTLs) in a German cohort and replicate over half of them in an Arab and Asian cohort. Fifty-five of the replicated pQTLs are located in trans. Our associations overlap with 57 genetic risk loci for 42 unique disease end points. We integrate this information into a genome-proteome network and provide an interactive web-tool for interrogations. Our results provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. </li> <li>CITATION : Suhre K, Arnold M, Bhagwat AM, Cotton RJ, ...&amp;, Graumann J.

Here we characterize the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome in healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL study. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a fourfold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development. </li> <li>CITATION : Sun BB, Maranville JC, Peters JE, Stacey D, ...&amp;, Butterworth AS.

A meta-analysis from two large cohorts of current and former smokers with and without COPD [SPIROMICS (N = 750); COPDGene (N = 590)] was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with measurement of 88 blood proteins (protein quantitative trait loci; pQTLs). PQTLs consistently replicated between the two cohorts. Features of pQTLs were compared to previously reported expression QTLs (eQTLs). Inference of causal relations of pQTL genotypes, biomarker measurements, and four clinical COPD phenotypes (airflow obstruction, emphysema, exacerbation history, and chronic bronchitis) were explored using conditional independence tests. We identified 527 highly significant (p 10% of measured variation in 13 protein biomarkers, with a single SNP (rs7041; p = 10-392) explaining 71%-75% of the measured variation in vitamin D binding protein (gene = GC). Some of these pQTLs [e.g., pQTLs for VDBP, sRAGE (gene = AGER), surfactant protein D (gene = SFTPD), and TNFRSF10C] have been previously associated with COPD phenotypes. Most pQTLs were local (cis), but distant (trans) pQTL SNPs in the ABO blood group locus were the top pQTL SNPs for five proteins. The inclusion of pQTL SNPs improved the clinical predictive value for the established association of sRAGE and emphysema, and the explanation of variance (R2) for emphysema improved from 0.3 to 0.4 when the pQTL SNP was included in the model along with clinical covariates. Causal modeling provided insight into specific pQTL-disease relationships for airflow obstruction and emphysema. In conclusion, given the frequency of highly significant local pQTLs, the large amount of variance potentially explained by pQTL, and the differences observed between pQTLs and eQTLs SNPs, we recommend that protein biomarker-disease association studies take into account the potential effect of common local SNPs and that pQTLs be integrated along with eQTLs to uncover disease mechanisms. Large-scale blood biomarker studies would also benefit from close attention to the ABO blood group. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Sun W, Kechris K, Jacobson S, Drummond MB, ...&amp;, COPDGene Investigators.

Genetic studies require populations varied in both ancestry and prevalent disease in order to optimize discovery and ensure generalizability of findings to the global population. Here, we report the genetic determinants of the serum proteome in 466 African Americans with chronic kidney disease attributed to hypertension from the richly phenotyped African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) study. Using the largest aptamer-based protein profiling platform to date (6,790 proteins or protein complexes), we identified 969 genetic associations with 900 unique proteins; including 52 novel cis (local) associations and 379 novel trans (distant) associations. The genetic effects of previously published cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were found to be highly reproducible, and we found evidence that our novel genetic signals colocalize with gene expression and disease processes. Many trans- pQTLs were found to reflect associations mediated by the circulating cis protein, and the common trans-pQTLs are enriched for processes involving extracellular vesicles, highlighting a plausible mechanism for distal regulation of the levels of secreted proteins. Thus, our study generates a valuable resource of genetic associations linking variants to protein levels and disease in an understudied patient population to inform future studies of drug targets and physiology. </li> <li>CITATION : Surapaneni A, Schlosser P, Zhou L, Liu C, ...&amp;, Grams ME.

However, it is not clear how well PGS translate between different populations, limiting their application to well-studied ethnicities. Proteins are intermediate traits linking genetic predisposition and environmental factors to disease, with numerous blood circulating protein levels representing functional readouts of disease-related processes. We hypothesized that studying the genetic architecture of a comprehensive set of blood-circulating proteins between a European and an Arab population could shed fresh light on the translatability of PGS to understudied populations. We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study with whole-genome sequencing data using 1301 proteins measured on the SOMAscan aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform in 2935 samples of Qatar Biobank and evaluated the replication of protein quantitative traits (pQTLs) from European studies in an Arab population. Then, we investigated the colocalization of shared pQTL signals between the two populations. Finally, we compared the performance of protein PGS derived from a Caucasian population in a European and an Arab cohort. We found that the majority of shared pQTL signals (81.8%) colocalized between both populations. About one-third of the genetic protein heritability was explained by protein PGS derived from a European cohort, with protein PGS performing ~ 20% better in Europeans when compared to Arabs. Our results are relevant for the translation of PGS to non-Caucasian populations, as well as for future efforts to extend genetic research to understudied populations. </li> <li>CITATION : Thareja G, Belkadi A, Arnold M, Albagha OME, ...&amp;, Suhre K.

We identified 274, 127 and 32 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and brain, respectively. cis-pQTLs were more likely to be tissue shared, but trans-pQTLs tended to be tissue specific. Between 48.0% and 76.6% of pQTLs did not co-localize with expression, splicing, DNA methylation or histone acetylation QTLs. Using Mendelian randomization, we nominated proteins implicated in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.

It is therefore of great interest to understand the interplay of genetic and environmental factors to determine the specific protein levels in individuals and to gain a deeper insight of the importance of genetic architecture related to the individual variability of plasma levels of proteins during adult life. METHODS: We have combined whole-genome sequencing, multiplex plasma protein profiling, and extensive clinical phenotyping in a longitudinal 2-year wellness study of 101 healthy individuals with repeated sampling. Analyses of genetic and non-genetic associations related to the variability of blood levels of proteins in these individuals were performed. RESULTS: The analyses showed that each individual has a unique protein profile, and we report on the intra-individual as well as inter-individual variation for 794 plasma proteins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 7.3 million genetic variants identified by whole-genome sequencing revealed 144 independent variants across 107 proteins that showed strong association (P &lt; 6 \u00d7 10-11) between genetics and the inter-individual variability on protein levels. Many proteins not reported before were identified (67 out of 107) with individual plasma level affected by genetics. Our longitudinal analysis further demonstrates that these levels are stable during the 2-year study period. The variability of protein profiles as a consequence of environmental factors was also analyzed with focus on the effects of weight loss and infections. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the adult blood levels of many proteins are determined at birth by genetics, which is important for efforts aimed to understand the relationship between plasma proteome profiles and human biology and disease. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhong W, Gummesson A, Tebani A, Karlsson MJ, ...&amp;, Uhl\u00e9n M.

We establish global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease.

Here we present data from the first phase of the Chinese Pangenome Consortium, including a collection of 116 high-quality and haplotype-phased de novo assemblies based on 58 core samples representing 36 minority Chinese ethnic groups. With an average 30.65\u00d7 high-fidelity long-read sequence coverage, an average contiguity N50 of more than 35.63 megabases and an average total size of 3.01 gigabases, the CPC core assemblies add 189 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,367 protein-coding gene duplications to GRCh38. We identified 15.9 million small variants and 78,072 structural variants, of which 5.9 million small variants and 34,223 structural variants were not reported in a recently released pangenome reference1. The Chinese Pangenome Consortium data demonstrate a remarkable increase in the discovery of novel and missing sequences when individuals are included from underrepresented minority ethnic groups. The missing reference sequences were enriched with archaic-derived alleles and genes that confer essential functions related to keratinization, response to ultraviolet radiation, DNA repair, immunological responses and lifespan, implying great potential for shedding new light on human evolution and recovering missing heritability in complex disease mapping. </li> <li>CITATION : Gao Y, Yang X, Chen H, Tan X, ...&amp;, Xu S.

The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Liao WW, Asri M, Ebler J, Doerr D, ...&amp;, Paten B.

The three tested coding systems were the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification Software for ICD-9-CM (CCS), and manually curated \"phecodes\" designed to facilitate phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) in EHRs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We selected 100 disease phenotypes and compared the ability of each coding system to accurately represent them without performing additional groupings. The 100 phenotypes included 25 randomly-chosen clinical phenotypes pursued in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and another 75 common disease phenotypes mentioned across free-text problem lists from 189,289 individuals. We then evaluated the performance of each coding system to replicate known associations for 440 SNP-phenotype pairs. RESULTS: Out of the 100 tested clinical phenotypes, phecodes exactly matched 83, compared to 53 for ICD-9-CM and 32 for CCS. ICD-9-CM codes were typically too detailed (requiring custom groupings) while CCS codes were often not granular enough. Among 440 tested known SNP-phenotype associations, use of phecodes replicated 153 SNP-phenotype pairs compared to 143 for ICD-9-CM and 139 for CCS. Phecodes also generally produced stronger odds ratios and lower p-values for known associations than ICD-9-CM and CCS. Finally, evaluation of several SNPs via PheWAS identified novel potential signals, some seen in only using the phecode approach. Among them, rs7318369 in PEPD was associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the phecode groupings better align with clinical diseases mentioned in clinical practice or for genomic studies. ICD-9-CM, CCS, and phecode groupings all worked for PheWAS-type studies, though the phecode groupings produced superior results. </li> <li>CITATION : Wei WQ, Bastarache LA, Carroll RJ, Marlo JE, ...&amp;, Denny JC.

The ~1.93 million curated interactions in BioGRID can be used to build complex networks to facilitate biomedical discoveries, particularly as related to human health and disease. All BioGRID content is curated from primary experimental evidence in the biomedical literature, and includes both focused low-throughput studies and large high-throughput datasets. BioGRID also captures protein post-translational modifications and protein or gene interactions with bioactive small molecules including many known drugs. A built-in network visualization tool combines all annotations and allows users to generate network graphs of protein, genetic and chemical interactions. In addition to general curation across species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in specific aspects of cellular regulation, for example the ubiquitin-proteasome system, as well as specific disease areas, such as for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome. A recent extension of BioGRID, named the Open Repository of CRISPR Screens (ORCS, orcs.thebiogrid.org), captures single mutant phenotypes and genetic interactions from published high throughput genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screens. BioGRID-ORCS contains datasets for over 1,042 CRISPR screens carried out to date in human, mouse and fly cell lines. The biomedical research community can freely access all BioGRID data through the web interface, standardized file downloads, or via model organism databases and partner meta-databases. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Oughtred R, Rust J, Chang C, Breitkreutz BJ, ...&amp;, Tyers M.

The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Szklarczyk D, Kirsch R, Koutrouli M, Nastou K, ...&amp;, von Mering C.

Each ethnic group has its unique genetic background with specific genomic variations influencing disease risk and drug response. Therefore, multi-omics data from specific ethnic populations are essential for the effective implementation of personalized medicine. Various prospective cohort studies, such as the UK Biobank, All of Us and Lifelines, have been conducted worldwide. The Tohoku Medical Megabank project was initiated after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. It collects biological specimens and conducts genome and omics analyses to build a basis for personalized medicine. Summary statistical data from these analyses are available in the jMorp web database (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp), which provides a multidimensional approach to the diversity of the Japanese population. jMorp was launched in 2015 as a public database for plasma metabolome and proteome analyses and has been continuously updated. The current update will significantly expand the scale of the data (metabolome, genome, transcriptome, and metagenome). In addition, the user interface and backend server implementations were rewritten to improve the connectivity between the items stored in jMorp. This paper provides an overview of the new version of the jMorp. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Tadaka S, Kawashima J, Hishinuma E, Saito S, ...&amp;, Kinoshita K.

We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type-specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from na\u00efve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of interindividual variation in the immune system. </li> <li>CITATION : Yazar S, Alquicira-Hernandez J, Wing K, Senabouth A, ...&amp;, Powell JE.

However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~106 cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data. </li> <li>CITATION : Korsunsky I, Millard N, Fan J, Slowikowski K, ...&amp;, Raychaudhuri S.

However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study's conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed. RESULTS: With scds, we propose two new approaches for in silico doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and, employing a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes, yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from original data. We apply our methods and existing computational doublet identification approaches to four datasets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, at comparably little computational cost. We observe appreciable differences between methods and across datasets and that no approach dominates all others. In summary, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotation of datasets with thousands of cells in a matter of seconds. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: scds is implemented as a Bioconductor R package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.scds).

However, any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA constitutes a background contamination that confounds the biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data. RESULTS: We demonstrate that contamination from this \"soup\" of cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating \"background-corrected\" cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics.

The ethnic diversity and geographic origins, which extend from eastern Europe to Asia, make the population uniquely positioned to investigate the shared properties of inherited disease risks between European and Asian ancestries. We present the analysis of genetic and phenotypic data from a cohort of 4,145 individuals collected in three metro areas in western Russia. We show the presence of multiple admixed genetic ancestry clusters spanning from primarily European to Asian and high identity-by-descent sharing with the Finnish population. As a result, there was notable enrichment of Finnish-specific variants in Russia. We illustrate the utility of Russian-descent cohorts for discovery of novel population-specific genetic associations, as well as replication of previously identified associations that were thought to be population-specific in other cohorts. Finally, we provide access to a database of allele frequencies and GWAS results for 464 phenotypes. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Usoltsev D, Kolosov N, Rotar O, Loboda A, ...&amp;, Artomov M.

These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P &lt; 2.6 \u00d7 10-11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of &lt;5% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Kurki MI, Karjalainen J, Palta P, Sipil\u00e4 TP, ...&amp;, Palotie A.

Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of &lt;5% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Kurki MI, Karjalainen J, Palta P, Sipil\u00e4 TP, ...&amp;, Palotie A.

However, most biobanks are primarily composed of individuals of European ancestry. We introduce the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI)-a collaborative network of 23 biobanks from 4 continents representing more than 2.2 million consented individuals with genetic data linked to electronic health records. GBMI meta-analyzes summary statistics from GWASs generated using harmonized genotypes and phenotypes from member biobanks for 14 exemplar diseases and endpoints. This strategy validates that GWASs conducted in diverse biobanks can be integrated despite heterogeneity in case definitions, recruitment strategies, and baseline characteristics. This collaborative effort improves GWAS power for diseases, benefits understudied diseases, and improves risk prediction while also enabling the nomination of disease genes and drug candidates by incorporating gene and protein expression data and providing insight into the underlying biology of human diseases and traits. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Zhou W, Kanai M, Wu KH, Rasheed H, ...&amp;, Neale BM.

Here, we conducted a genetic analysis of 104 pregnancy phenotypes in 20,900 Chinese women. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a total of 410 trait-locus associations, with 71.71% reported previously. Among the 116 novel hits for 45 phenotypes, 83 were successfully replicated. Among them, 31 were defined as potentially pregnancy-specific associations, including creatine and HELLPAR and neutrophils and ESR1, with subsequent analysis revealing enrichments in estrogen-related pathways and female reproductive tissues. The partitioning heritability underscored the significant roles of fetal blood, embryoid bodies, and female reproductive organs in pregnancy hematology and birth outcomes. Pathway analysis confirmed the intricate interplay of hormone and immune regulation, metabolism, and cell cycle during pregnancy. This study contributes to the understanding of genetic influences on pregnancy phenotypes and their implications for maternal health. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Xiao H, Li L, Yang M, Zhang X, ...&amp;, Jin X.

Exome-sequencing studies of population biobanks provide an opportunity to systematically evaluate the impact of rare coding variations across a wide range of phenotypes to discover genes and allelic series relevant to human health and disease. Here, we present results from systematic association analyses of 4,529 phenotypes using single-variant and gene tests of 394,841 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome-sequence data. We find that the discovery of genetic associations is tightly linked to frequency and is correlated with metrics of deleteriousness and natural selection. We highlight biological findings elucidated by these data and release the dataset as a public resource alongside the Genebass browser for rapidly exploring rare-variant association results. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Karczewski KJ, Solomonson M, Chao KR, Goodrich JK, ...&amp;, Neale BM.

The Catalog contains variant-trait associations and supporting metadata for &gt;45 000 published GWAS across &gt;5000 human traits, and &gt;40 000 full P-value summary statistics datasets. Content is curated from publications or acquired via author submission of prepublication summary statistics through a new submission portal and validation tool. GWAS data volume has vastly increased in recent years. We have updated our software to meet this scaling challenge and to enable rapid release of submitted summary statistics. The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS. Interoperability of the Catalog has been enhanced through links to other resources including the Polygenic Score Catalog and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, refinements to GWAS trait annotation, and the development of a standard format for GWAS data. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Sollis E, Mosaku A, Abid A, Buniello A, ...&amp;, Harris LW.

However, the definition of its genetic architecture is limited by the technical challenge of capturing dynamic flow volumes from cardiac imaging at scale. We present DeepFlow, a deep-learning system to extract cardiac flow and volumes from phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A mixed-linear model applied to 37,653 individuals from the UK Biobank reveals genome-wide significant associations across cardiac dynamic flow volumes spanning from aortic forward velocity to aortic regurgitation fraction. Mendelian randomization reveals a causal role for aortic root size in aortic valve regurgitation. Among the most significant contributing variants, localizing genes (near ELN, PRDM6 and ADAMTS7) are implicated in connective tissue and blood pressure pathways. Here we show that DeepFlow cardiac flow phenotyping at scale, combined with genotyping data, reinforces the contribution of connective tissue genes, blood pressure and root size to aortic valve function. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Gomes B, Singh A, O'Sullivan JW, Schnurr TM, ...&amp;, Ashley EA.

Notable significant, interpretable associations include: iron transport and storage genes, related to magnetic susceptibility of subcortical brain tissue; extracellular matrix and epidermal growth factor genes, associated with white matter micro-structure and lesions; genes that regulate mid-line axon development, associated with organization of the pontine crossing tract; and overall 17 genes involved in development, pathway signalling and plasticity.

We developed an abdominal MRI-based machine-learning algorithm to accurately estimate liver fat (correlation coefficients, 0.97-0.99) from a truth dataset of 4,511 middle-aged UK Biobank participants, enabling quantification in 32,192 additional individuals. 17% of participants had predicted liver fat levels indicative of steatosis, and liver fat could not have been reliably estimated based on clinical factors such as BMI. A genome-wide association study of common genetic variants and liver fat replicated three known associations and identified five newly associated variants in or near the MTARC1, ADH1B, TRIB1, GPAM, and MAST3 genes (p 1.32 per SD score, p &lt; 9 \u00d7 10-17). Rare inactivating variants in the APOB or MTTP genes were identified in 0.8% of individuals with steatosis and conferred more than 6-fold risk (p &lt; 2 \u00d7 10-5), highlighting a molecular subtype of hepatic steatosis characterized by defective secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. We demonstrate that our imaging-based machine-learning model accurately estimates liver fat and may be useful in epidemiological and genetic studies of hepatic steatosis. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Haas ME, Pirruccello JP, Friedman SN, Wang M, ...&amp;, Khera AV.

While environmental risk factors have been identified, it remains unclear to what extent the flow is regulated by genetics. Here we performed heritability and genome-wide association analyses of cerebral blood flow in a population-based cohort study. We included 4472 persons free of cortical infarcts who underwent genotyping and phase-contrast magnetic resonance flow imaging (mean age 64.8 \u00b1 10.8 years). The flow rate, cross-sectional area of the vessel, and flow velocity through the vessel were measured in the basilar artery and bilateral carotids. We found that the flow rate of the basilar artery is most heritable (h2 (SE) = 24.1 (9.8), p-value = 0.0056), and this increased over age. The association studies revealed two significant loci for the right carotid artery area (rs12546630, p-value = 2.0 \u00d7 10-8) and velocity (rs2971609, p-value = 1.4 \u00d7 10-8), with the latter showing a concordant effect in an independent sample (N = 1350, p-value = 0.057, meta-analyzed p-value = 2.5 \u00d7 10-9). These loci were also associated with other cerebral blood flow parameters below genome-wide significance, and rs2971609 lies in a known migraine locus. These findings establish that cerebral blood flow is under genetic control with potential relevance for neurological diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Ikram MA, Zonneveld HI, Roshchupkin G, Smith AV, ...&amp;, Adams HH.

They allow the discovery of associations between genetic variants and brain imaging features. They are invaluable resources to study the influence of genetics and environment in the brain features variance observed in normal and pathological populations. This study presents a genome-wide haplotype analysis for 123 brain sulcus opening value (a measure of sulcal width) across the whole brain that include 16,304 subjects from UK Biobank. Using genetic maps, we defined 119,548 blocks of low recombination rate distributed along the 22 autosomal chromosomes and analyzed 1,051,316 haplotypes. To test associations between haplotypes and complex traits, we designed three statistical approaches. Two of them use a model that includes all the haplotypes for a single block, while the last approach considers each haplotype independently. All the statistics produced were assessed as rigorously as possible. Thanks to the rich imaging dataset at hand, we used resampling techniques to assess False Positive Rate for each statistical approach in a genome-wide and brain-wide context. The results on real data show that genome-wide haplotype analyses are more sensitive than single-SNP approach and account for local complex Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) structure, which makes genome-wide haplotype analysis an interesting and statistically sound alternative to the single-SNP counterpart. </li> <li>CITATION : Karkar S, Dandine-Roulland C, Mangin JF, Le Guen Y, ...&amp;, Frouin V.

We identify 12 genome-wide associations (1 known at TTN and 11 novel for left ventricular mass), implicating genes previously associated with cardiac contractility and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived indexed left ventricular mass is associated with incident dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant. An indexed left ventricular mass polygenic risk score \u226590th percentile is also associated with incident implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant in separate UK Biobank (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.44) and Mass General Brigham (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.74) samples.

We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study for facial shape phenotypes in multiple discovery and replication cohorts, considering almost ten thousand individuals of European descent from several countries. Phenotyping of facial shape features was based on landmark data obtained from three-dimensional head magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and two-dimensional portrait images. We identified five independent genetic loci associated with different facial phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of five candidate genes--PRDM16, PAX3, TP63, C5orf50, and COL17A1--in the determination of the human face. Three of them have been implicated previously in vertebrate craniofacial development and disease, and the remaining two genes potentially represent novel players in the molecular networks governing facial development. Our finding at PAX3 influencing the position of the nasion replicates a recent GWAS of facial features. In addition to the reported GWA findings, we established links between common DNA variants previously associated with NSCL/P at 2p21, 8q24, 13q31, and 17q22 and normal facial-shape variations based on a candidate gene approach. Overall our study implies that DNA variants in genes essential for craniofacial development contribute with relatively small effect size to the spectrum of normal variation in human facial morphology. This observation has important consequences for future studies aiming to identify more genes involved in the human facial morphology, as well as for potential applications of DNA prediction of facial shape such as in future forensic applications. </li> <li>CITATION : Liu F, van der Lijn F, Schurmann C, Zhu G, ...&amp;, Kayser M.

Traditional vascular risk factors have been associated with BADs, but whether there may be genetic determinants of BADs is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors studied 4150 participants from 6 geographically diverse population-based cohorts (40% European, 14% African, 22% Hispanic, 24% Asian ancestries). Brain arterial diameters for 13 segments were measured and averaged to obtain a global measure of BADs as well as the posterior and anterior circulations. A genome-wide association study revealed 14 variants at one locus associated with global BAD at genome-wide significance (P&lt;5\u00d710-8) (top single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs7921574; \u03b2=0.06 [P=1.54\u00d710-8]). This locus mapped to an intron of CNNM2. A trans-ancestry genome-wide association study meta-analysis identified 2 more loci at NT5C2 (rs10748839; P=2.54\u00d710-8) and AS3MT (rs10786721; P=4.97\u00d710-8), associated with global BAD. In addition, 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms colocalized with expression of CNNM2 (rs7897654; \u03b2=0.12 [P=6.17\u00d710-7]) and AL356608.1 (rs10786719; \u03b2=-0.17 [P=6.60\u00d710-6]) in brain tissue. For the posterior BAD, 2 variants at one locus mapped to an intron of TCF25 were identified (top single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs35994878; \u03b2=0.11 [P=2.94\u00d710-8]). For the anterior BAD, one locus at ADAP1 was identified in trans-ancestry genome-wide association analysis (rs34217249; P=3.11\u00d710-8). CONCLUSIONS: The current study reveals 3 novel risk loci (CNNM2, NT5C2, and AS3MT) associated with BADs.

While socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic risk factors have been identified, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required to develop more effective interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess organ health, but biobank-scale studies are still in their infancy. Using over 38,000 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep learning to quantify volume, fat, and iron in seven organs and tissues, and demonstrate that imaging-derived phenotypes reflect health status. We show that these traits have a substantial heritable component (8-44%) and identify 93 independent genome-wide significant associations, including four associations with liver traits that have not previously been reported. Our work demonstrates the tractability of deep learning to systematically quantify health parameters from high-throughput MRI across a range of organs and tissues, and use the largest-ever study of its kind to generate new insights into the genetic architecture of these traits. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Liu Y, Basty N, Whitcher B, Bell JD, ...&amp;, Cule M.

Genome-wide association studies of CMR-derived 12 LVRWTs identified 72 significant genetic loci associated with at least one LVRWT phenotype (P &lt; 5 \u00d7 10-8), which were revealed to actively participate in heart development and contraction pathways. Significant causal relationships were observed between the LVRWT traits and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses (P &lt; 0.01). The polygenic risk score of inferoseptal LVRWT at end systole exhibited a notable association with incident HCM, facilitating the identification of high-risk individuals.

Second, we explored the effects of the cT1 variants on liver blood tests, and a range of metabolic traits and diseases. Third, we used Mendelian randomisation to test the causal effects of 24 predominantly metabolic traits on liver cT1 measures. RESULTS: We identified 6 independent genetic variants associated with liver cT1 that reached the GWAS significance threshold (p &lt;5\u00d710-8). Four of the variants (rs759359281 in SLC30A10, rs13107325 in SLC39A8, rs58542926 in TM6SF2, rs738409 in PNPLA3) were also associated with elevated aminotransferases and had variable effects on liver fat and other metabolic traits. Insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver and body mass index were causally associated with elevated cT1, whilst favourable adiposity (instrumented by variants associated with higher adiposity but lower risk of cardiometabolic disease and lower liver fat) was found to be protective. CONCLUSION: The association between 2 metal ion transporters and cT1 indicates an important new mechanism in steatohepatitis. Future studies are needed to determine whether interventions targeting the identified transporters might prevent liver disease in at-risk individuals. LAY SUMMARY: We estimated levels of liver inflammation and scarring based on magnetic resonance imaging of 14,440 UK Biobank participants. We performed a genetic study and identified variations in 6 genes associated with levels of liver inflammation and scarring. Participants with variations in 4 of these genes also had higher levels of markers of liver cell injury in blood samples, further validating their role in liver health. Two identified genes are involved in the transport of metal ions in our body. Further investigation of these variations may lead to better detection, assessment, and/or treatment of liver inflammation and scarring. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Parisinos CA, Wilman HR, Thomas EL, Kelly M, ...&amp;, Yaghootkar H.

We perform a genetic study of three MRI markers of the disease in UK Biobank imaging data and other sources: white matter hyperintensities (N = 42,310), fractional anisotropy (N = 17,663) and mean diffusivity (N = 17,467). Our aim is to better understand the disease pathophysiology. Across the three traits, we identify 31 loci, of which 21 were previously unreported. We perform a transcriptome-wide association study to identify associations with gene expression in relevant tissues, identifying 66 associated genes across the three traits.

Many rare genetic variants have been associated with DCM, but common variant studies of the disease have yielded few associated loci. As structural changes in the heart are a defining feature of DCM, we report a genome-wide association study of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived left ventricular measurements in 36,041 UK Biobank participants, with replication in 2184 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We identify 45 previously unreported loci associated with cardiac structure and function, many near well-established genes for Mendelian cardiomyopathies. A polygenic score of MRI-derived left ventricular end systolic volume strongly associates with incident DCM in the general population. Even among carriers of TTN truncating mutations, this polygenic score influences the size and function of the human heart. These results further implicate common genetic polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of DCM. </li> <li>CITATION : Pirruccello JP, Bick A, Wang M, Chaffin M, ...&amp;, Aragam KG.

Damaging biophysical, metabolic and immunological factors exceed endogenous repair mechanisms resulting in a pro-fibrotic state, cellular senescence and end-organ damage, however the genetic architecture of cardiovascular ageing is not known. Here we use machine learning approaches to quantify cardiovascular age from image-derived traits of vascular function, cardiac motion and myocardial fibrosis, as well as conduction traits from electrocardiograms, in 39,559 participants of UK Biobank. Cardiovascular ageing is found to be significantly associated with common or rare variants in genes regulating sarcomere homeostasis, myocardial immunomodulation, and tissue responses to biophysical stress. Ageing is accelerated by cardiometabolic risk factors and we also identify prescribed medications that are potential modifiers of ageing. Through large-scale modelling of ageing across multiple traits our results reveal insights into the mechanisms driving premature cardiovascular ageing and reveal potential molecular targets to attenuate age-related processes. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Shah M, de A In\u00e1cio MH, Lu C, Schiratti PR, ...&amp;, O'Regan DP.

Here we present a new open resource of genome-wide association study summary statistics, using the 2020 data release, almost tripling the discovery sample size. We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial disorders. </li> <li>CITATION : Smith SM, Douaud G, Chen W, Hanayik T, ...&amp;, Elliott LT.

We integrated brain eQTLs to refine genes for various loci, implicated several genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, and highlighted global genetic correlations with neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures tissue magnetic susceptibility and has been shown to detect pathological changes in tissue iron, myelin and calcification. We present an open resource of QSM-based imaging measures of multiple brain structures in 35,273 individuals from the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study. We identify statistically significant associations of 251 phenotypes with magnetic susceptibility that include body iron, disease, diet and alcohol consumption. Genome-wide associations relate magnetic susceptibility to 76 replicating clusters of genetic variants with biological functions involving iron, calcium, myelin and extracellular matrix. These patterns of associations include relationships that are unique to QSM, in particular being complementary to T2* signal decay time measures. These new imaging phenotypes are being integrated into the core UK Biobank measures provided to researchers worldwide, creating the potential to discover new, non-invasive markers of brain health. </li> <li>CITATION : Wang C, Martins-Bach AB, Alfaro-Almagro F, Douaud G, ...&amp;, Miller KL.

Here we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 13 structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived cortical phenotypes, measured globally and at 180 bilaterally averaged regions in 36,663 individuals and identified 4,349 experiment-wide significant loci. These phenotypes include cortical thickness, surface area, gray matter volume, measures of folding, neurite density and water diffusion. We identified four genetic latent structures and causal relationships between surface area and some measures of cortical folding. These latent structures partly relate to different underlying gene expression trajectories during development and are enriched for different cell types. We also identified differential enrichment for neurodevelopmental and constrained genes and demonstrate that common genetic variants associated with cortical expansion are associated with cephalic disorders. Finally, we identified complex interphenotype and inter-regional genetic relationships among the 13 phenotypes, reflecting the developmental differences among them. Together, these analyses identify distinct genetic organizational principles of the cortex and their correlates with neurodevelopment. </li> <li>CITATION : Warrier V, Stauffer EM, Huang QQ, Wigdor EM, ...&amp;, Bethlehem RAI.

However, investigating their association with genetic variation requires non-standard methods. We propose transferGWAS, a novel approach to perform genome-wide association studies directly on full medical images. First, we learn semantically meaningful representations of the images based on a transfer learning task, during which a deep neural network is trained on independent but similar data. Then, we perform genetic association tests with these representations. RESULTS: We validate the type I error rates and power of transferGWAS in simulation studies of synthetic images. Then we apply transferGWAS in a genome-wide association study of retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank. This first-of-a-kind GWAS of full imaging data yielded 60 genomic regions associated with retinal fundus images, of which 7 are novel candidate loci for eye-related traits and diseases.

IWAS extends the promising transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) from using gene expression endophenotypes to using imaging and other endophenotypes with a much wider range of possible applications. As illustration, we use gray-matter volumes of several brain regions of interest (ROIs) drawn from the ADNI-1 structural MRI data as imaging endophenotypes, which are then applied to the individual-level GWAS data of ADNI-GO/2 and a large meta-analyzed GWAS summary statistics dataset (based on about 74,000 individuals), uncovering some novel genes significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also compare the performance of IWAS with TWAS, showing much larger numbers of significant AD-associated genes discovered by IWAS, presumably due to the stronger link between brain atrophy and AD than that between gene expression of normal individuals and the risk for AD. The proposed IWAS is general and can be applied to other imaging endophenotypes, and GWAS individual-level or summary association data. </li> <li>CITATION : Xu Z, Wu C, Pan W, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

Leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we devise robust risk assessment models for T2D. Drawing upon comprehensive genetic and medical imaging datasets from 68,911 individuals in the Taiwan Biobank, our models integrate Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), Multi-image Risk Scores (MRS), and demographic variables, such as age, sex, and T2D family history. Here, we show that our model achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively identifying high-risk T2D subgroups. A streamlined model featuring eight key variables also maintains a high AUC of 0.939. This high accuracy for T2D risk assessment promises to catalyze early detection and preventive strategies. Moreover, we introduce an accessible online risk assessment tool for T2D, facilitating broader applicability and dissemination of our findings. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Huang YJ, Chen CH, Yang HC.

Knowledge of genetic variation in metabolism has many applications of biomedical and pharmaceutical interests, including the functional understanding of genetic associations with clinical end points, design of strategies to correct dysregulations in metabolic disorders and the identification of genetic effect modifiers of metabolic disease biomarkers. Furthermore, it has been shown that GIMs provide testable hypotheses for functional genomics and metabolomics and for the identification of novel gene functions and metabolite identities. mGWAS with growing sample sizes and increasingly complex metabolic trait panels are being conducted, allowing for more comprehensive and systems-based downstream analyses. The generated large datasets of genetic associations can now be mined by the biomedical research community and provide valuable resources for hypothesis-driven studies. In this review, we provide a brief summary of the key aspects of mGWAS, followed by an update of recently published mGWAS.

Here we performed association studies of Olink Explore 3072 data generated by the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project1 on plasma samples from more than 50,000 UK Biobank participants with phenotypic and genotypic data, stratifying on British or Irish, African and South Asian ancestries. We compared the results with those of a SomaScan v4 study on plasma from 36,000 Icelandic people2, for 1,514 of whom Olink data were also available. We found modest correlation between the two platforms. Although cis protein quantitative trait loci were detected for a similar absolute number of assays on the two platforms (2,101 on Olink versus 2,120 on SomaScan), the proportion of assays with such supporting evidence for assay performance was higher on the Olink platform (72% versus 43%). A considerable number of proteins had genomic associations that differed between the platforms. We provide examples where differences between platforms may influence conclusions drawn from the integration of protein levels with the study of diseases. We demonstrate how leveraging the diverse ancestries of participants in the UK Biobank helps to detect novel associations and refine genomic location. Our results show the value of the information provided by the two most commonly used high-throughput proteomics platforms and demonstrate the differences between them that at times provides useful complementarity. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Eldjarn GH, Ferkingstad E, Lund SH, Helgason H, ...&amp;, Stefansson K.

These proteins can be important clinical biomarkers in disease and also possible drug targets. Large scale genomics studies of circulating proteins can identify genetic variants that lead to relative protein abundance. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis on genome-wide association studies of autosomal chromosomes in 22,997 individuals of primarily European ancestry across 12 cohorts to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for 92 cardiometabolic associated plasma proteins. RESULTS: We identified 503 (337 cis and 166 trans) conditionally independent pQTLs, including several novel variants not reported in the literature. We conducted a sex-stratified analysis and found that 118 (23.5%) of pQTLs demonstrated heterogeneity between sexes. The direction of effect was preserved but there were differences in effect size and significance. Additionally, we annotate trans-pQTLs with nearest genes and report plausible biological relationships. Using Mendelian randomization, we identified causal associations for 18 proteins across 19 phenotypes, of which 10 have additional genetic colocalization evidence. We highlight proteins associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic traits including angiopoietin-related protein 7 (ANGPTL7) and Semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F). CONCLUSION: Through large-scale analysis of protein quantitative trait loci, we provide a comprehensive overview of common variants associated with plasma proteins. We highlight possible biological relationships which may serve as a basis for further investigation into possible causal roles in cardiometabolic diseases. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Carland C, Png G, Malarstig A, Kho PF, ...&amp;, Assimes T.

Recent large-scale studies have reported genetic (i.e., protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) and non-genetic factors, such as age and sex, as major determinants to inter-individual variability in immune response variation. However, the contribution of blood-cell composition to plasma protein heterogeneity has not been fully characterized and may act as a mediating factor in association studies. METHODS: Here, we evaluated plasma protein levels from 400 unrelated healthy individuals of western European ancestry, who were stratified by sex and two decades of life (20-29 and 60-69 years), from the Milieu Int\u00e9rieur cohort. We quantified 229 proteins by Luminex in a clinically certified laboratory and their levels of variation were analyzed together with 5.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With respect to non-genetic variables, we included 254 lifestyle and biochemical factors, as well as counts of seven circulating immune cell populations measured by hemogram and standardized flow cytometry. RESULTS: Collectively, we found 152 significant associations involving 49 proteins and 20 non-genetic variables. Consistent with previous studies, age and sex showed a global, pervasive impact on plasma protein heterogeneity, while body mass index and other health status variables were among the non-genetic factors with the highest number of associations. After controlling for these covariates, we identified 100 and 12 pQTLs acting in cis and trans, respectively, collectively associated with 87 plasma proteins and including 19 novel genetic associations. Genetic factors explained the largest fraction of the variability of plasma protein levels, as compared to non-genetic factors. In addition, blood-cell fractions, including leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets, had a larger contribution to inter-individual variability than age and sex and appeared as confounders of specific genetic associations. Finally, we identified new genetic associations with plasma protein levels of five monogenic Mendelian disease genes including two primary immunodeficiency genes (Ficolin-3 and FAS). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified novel genetic and non-genetic factors associated to plasma protein levels which may inform health status and disease management. </li> <li>CITATION : Caron B, Patin E, Rotival M, Charbit B, ...&amp;, Milieu Int\u00e9rieur Consortium.

Because previous proteogenomic studies have focused on common variation via genome-wide association studies, the contribution of rare variants to the plasma proteome remains largely unknown. Here we identify associations between rare protein-coding variants and 2,923 plasma protein abundances measured in 49,736 UK Biobank individuals. Our variant-level exome-wide association study identified 5,433 rare genotype-protein associations, of which 81% were undetected in a previous genome-wide association study of the same cohort5. We then looked at aggregate signals using gene-level collapsing analysis, which revealed 1,962 gene-protein associations. Of the 691 gene-level signals from protein-truncating variants, 99.4% were associated with decreased protein levels. STAB1 and STAB2, encoding scavenger receptors involved in plasma protein clearance, emerged as pleiotropic loci, with 77 and 41 protein associations, respectively. We demonstrate the utility of our publicly accessible resource through several applications. These include detailing an allelic series in NLRC4, identifying potential biomarkers for a fatty liver disease-associated variant in HSD17B13 and bolstering phenome-wide association studies by integrating protein quantitative trait loci with protein-truncating variants in collapsing analyses. Finally, we uncover distinct proteomic consequences of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), including an association between TET2-CH and increased FLT3 levels. Our results highlight a considerable role for rare variation in plasma protein abundance and the value of proteogenomics in therapeutic discovery. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Dhindsa RS, Burren OS, Sun BB, Prins BP, ...&amp;, Petrovski S.

Proteins are crucial components in biological pathways dysregulated in disease states. Identifying genetic components that influence circulating protein levels may lead to the discovery of biomarkers for early stages of disease or offer opportunities as therapeutic targets. METHODS: Here, we carry out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilising whole genome sequencing data in 3,005 individuals from the HELIC founder populations cohort, across 92 proteins of cardiometabolic relevance. RESULTS: We report 322 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) signals across 92 proteins, of which 76 are located in or near the coding gene (cis-pQTL). We link those association signals with changes in protein expression and cardiometabolic disease risk using colocalisation and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of previously unknown signals we describe point to proteins or protein interactions involved in inflammation and immune response, providing genetic evidence for the contributing role of inflammation in cardiometabolic disease processes. </li> <li>CITATION : Gilly A, Park YC, Tsafantakis E, Karaleftheri M, ...&amp;, Zeggini E.

Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) were identified as associations between genetic variants and proteins, with 176 pQTLs for 145 CSF proteins (P &lt; 1.25 \u00d7 10-10 , 117 cis-pQTLs and 59 trans-pQTLs). Ventricular volume (measured with brain magnetic resonance imaging) was a confounder for several pQTLs. pQTLs for CSF and plasma proteins were overall correlated, but CSF-specific pQTLs were also observed. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested causal roles for several proteins, for example, ApoE, CD33, and GRN in Alzheimer's disease, MMP-10 in preclinical Alzheimer's disease, SIGLEC9 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and CD38, GPNMB, and ADAM15 in Parkinson's disease. CSF levels of GRN, MMP-10, and GPNMB were altered in Alzheimer's disease, preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, respectively.

Using Olink proteomics data for 1,463 proteins measured in over 54,000 samples of the UK Biobank, we identified 4,248 associations with 2,821 ratios between protein levels (rQTLs). rQTLs were 7.6-fold enriched in known protein-protein interactions, suggesting that their ratios reflect biological links between the implicated proteins. Conducting a GWAS on ratios increased the number of discovered genetic signals by 24.7%. The approach can identify novel loci of clinical relevance, support causal gene identification, and reveal complex networks of interacting proteins.

We present comprehensive protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 81% are previously undescribed, alongside ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-European individuals. The study provides an updated characterization of the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome, contextualized with projected pQTL discovery rates as sample sizes and proteomic assay coverages increase over time. We offer extensive insights into trans pQTLs across multiple biological domains, highlight genetic influences on ligand-receptor interactions and pathway perturbations across a diverse collection of cytokines and complement networks, and illustrate long-range epistatic effects of ABO blood group and FUT2 secretor status on proteins with gastrointestinal tissue-enriched expression. We demonstrate the utility of these data for drug discovery by extending the genetic proxied effects of protein targets, such as PCSK9, on additional endpoints, and disentangle specific genes and proteins perturbed at loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility.

Based on data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry technique, we conduct genome-wide association analyses for 304 unique proteins in 2,958 Han Chinese participants. We identify 195 genetic variant-protein associations. Colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses highlight 60 gene-protein-phenotype associations, 45 of which (75%) have not been prioritized in Europeans previously. Further cross-ancestry analyses uncover key proteins that contributed to the differences in the obesity-induced diabetes and coronary artery disease susceptibility.

We detected 504 proteins affected by HLA variants (HLA-pQTL), including widespread trans effects by autoimmune disease risk alleles. More than 80% of the HLA-pQTL fine-mapped to amino acid positions in the peptide binding groove. HLA-I and II affected proteins expressed in similar cell types but in different pathways of both adaptive and innate immunity. Finally, we investigated potential HLA-pQTL effects on disease by integrating HLA-pQTL with fine-mapped HLA-disease signals in the UK Biobank.

But multi-omic traits can be genetically predicted, which enables highly cost-effective and powerful analyses for studies that do not have multi-omics1. Here we examine a large cohort (the INTERVAL study2; n = 50,000 participants) with extensive multi-omic data for plasma proteomics (SomaScan, n = 3,175; Olink, n = 4,822), plasma metabolomics (Metabolon HD4, n = 8,153), serum metabolomics (Nightingale, n = 37,359) and whole-blood Illumina RNA sequencing (n = 4,136), and use machine learning to train genetic scores for 17,227 molecular traits, including 10,521 that reach Bonferroni-adjusted significance. We evaluate the performance of genetic scores through external validation across cohorts of individuals of European, Asian and African American ancestries. In addition, we show the utility of these multi-omic genetic scores by quantifying the genetic control of biological pathways and by generating a synthetic multi-omic dataset of the UK Biobank3 to identify disease associations using a phenome-wide scan. We highlight a series of biological insights with regard to genetic mechanisms in metabolism and canonical pathway associations with disease; for example, JAK-STAT signalling and coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, we develop a portal ( https://www.omicspred.org/ ) to facilitate public access to all genetic scores and validation results, as well as to serve as a platform for future extensions and enhancements of multi-omic genetic scores. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Xu Y, Ritchie SC, Liang Y, Timmers PRHJ, ...&amp;, Inouye M.

Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies. </li> <li>CITATION : Alexander DH, Novembre J, Lange K.

Computer programs such as ADMIXTURE and STRUCTURE are commonly employed to estimate the admixture proportions of sample individuals. However, these programs can be overwhelmed by the computational burdens imposed by the 105 to 106 samples and millions of markers commonly found in modern biobanks. An attractive strategy is to run these programs on a set of ancestry-informative SNP markers (AIMs) that exhibit substantially different frequencies across populations. Unfortunately, existing methods for identifying AIMs require knowing ancestry labels for a subset of the sample. This supervised learning approach creates a chicken and the egg scenario. In this paper, we present an unsupervised, scalable framework that seamlessly carries out AIM selection and likelihood-based estimation of admixture proportions. Our simulated and real data examples show that this approach is scalable to modern biobank datasets. OpenADMIXTURE, our Julia implementation of the method, is open source and available for free. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Ko S, Chu BB, Peterson D, Okenwa C, ...&amp;, Lange KL.

To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires \u223c4 min to perform gene-based annotation and \u223c15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day.

Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ~356,660 candidate SNPs in ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ~1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ~15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ~4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S ~0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory. </li> <li>CITATION : Cingolani P, Platts A, Wang leL, Coon M, ...&amp;, Ruden DM.

However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes1. Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Karczewski KJ, Francioli LC, Tiao G, Cummings BB, ...&amp;, MacArthur DG.

We developed a new method (case-case genome-wide association study; CC-GWAS) to test for differences in allele frequency between cases of two disorders using summary statistics from the respective case-control GWAS, transcending current methods that require individual-level data. Simulations and analytical computations confirm that CC-GWAS is well powered with effective control of type I error. We applied CC-GWAS to publicly available summary statistics for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and five other psychiatric disorders. CC-GWAS identified 196 independent case-case loci, including 72 CC-GWAS-specific loci that were not significant at the genome-wide level in the input case-control summary statistics; two of the CC-GWAS-specific loci implicate the genes KLF6 and KLF16 (from the Kr\u00fcppel-like family of transcription factors), which have been linked to neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration. CC-GWAS loci replicated convincingly in applications to datasets with independent replication data. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Peyrot WJ, Price AL.

One among these is the study of biomarker trajectories. For example, high blood pressure measurements over visits strongly predict stroke onset, and consistently high fasting glucose and Hb1Ac levels define diabetes. Recent research reveals that not only the mean level of biomarker trajectories but also their fluctuations, or within-subject (WS) variability, are risk factors for many diseases. Glycemic variation, for instance, is recently considered an important clinical metric in diabetes management. It is crucial to identify the genetic factors that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. Compared to traditional cross-sectional studies, trajectory analysis utilizes more data points and captures a complete picture of the impact of time-varying factors, including medication history and lifestyle. Currently, there are no efficient tools for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of biomarker trajectories at the biobank scale, even for just mean effects. We propose TrajGWAS, a linear mixed effect model-based method for testing genetic effects that shift the mean or alter the WS variability of a biomarker trajectory. It is scalable to biobank data with 100,000 to 1,000,000 individuals and many longitudinal measurements and robust to distributional assumptions. Simulation studies corroborate that TrajGWAS controls the type I error rate and is powerful. Analysis of eleven biomarkers measured longitudinally and extracted from UK Biobank primary care data for more than 150,000 participants with 1,800,000 observations reveals loci that significantly alter the mean or WS variability. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Ko S, German CA, Jensen A, Shen J, ...&amp;, Zhou JJ.

In some situations (such as studies of late-onset or rapidly lethal diseases), it may be more practical to identify family members of cases. In randomly ascertained cohorts, replacing cases with their first-degree relatives enables studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly absent) in the cohort. We refer to this approach as genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX) and apply it to 12 common diseases in 116,196 individuals from the UK Biobank. Meta-analysis with published genome-wide association study summary statistics replicated established risk loci and yielded four newly associated loci for Alzheimer's disease, eight for coronary artery disease and five for type 2 diabetes. In addition to informing disease biology, our results demonstrate the utility of association mapping without directly observing cases. We anticipate that GWAX will prove useful in future genetic studies of complex traits in large population cohorts. </li> <li>CITATION : Liu JZ, Erlich Y, Pickrell JK.

We developed an association method based on posterior mean genetic liabilities under a liability threshold model, conditional on case-control status and family history (LT-FH). Analyzing 12 diseases from the UK Biobank (average N = 350,000) we compared LT-FH to genome-wide association without using family history (GWAS) and a previous proxy-based method incorporating family history (GWAX). LT-FH was 63% (standard error (s.e.) 6%) more powerful than GWAS and 36% (s.e. 4%) more powerful than the trait-specific maximum of GWAS and GWAX, based on the number of independent genome-wide-significant loci across all diseases (for example, 690 loci for LT-FH versus 423 for GWAS); relative improvements were similar when applying BOLT-LMM to GWAS, GWAX and LT-FH phenotypes. Thus, LT-FH greatly increases association power when family history of disease is available. </li> <li>CITATION : Hujoel MLA, Gazal S, Loh PR, Patterson N, ...&amp;, Price AL.

Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Howe LJ, Nivard MG, Morris TT, Hansen AF, ...&amp;, Davies NM.

Within-family genetic variation is random, enabling unbiased estimation of direct genetic effects when parents are genotyped. However, parental genotypes are often missing. We introduce a method that imputes missing parental genotypes and estimates direct genetic effects. Our method, implemented in the software package snipar (single-nucleotide imputation of parents), gives more precise estimates of direct genetic effects than existing approaches. Using 39,614 individuals from the UK Biobank with at least one genotyped sibling/parent, we estimate the correlation between direct genetic effects and effects from standard GWASs for nine phenotypes, including educational attainment (r = 0.739, standard error (s.e.) = 0.086) and cognitive ability (r = 0.490, s.e. = 0.086).

Here we present a novel machine-learning method called REGENIE for fitting a whole-genome regression model for quantitative and binary phenotypes that is substantially faster than alternatives in multi-trait analyses while maintaining statistical efficiency. The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test for unbalanced case-control phenotypes. The method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of this approach using the UK Biobank dataset with up to 407,746 individuals. </li> <li>CITATION : Mbatchou J, Barnard L, Backman J, Marcketta A, ...&amp;, Marchini J.

The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies. We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance-component test, SKAT can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using SKAT to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that SKAT can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests. We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Wu MC, Lee S, Cai T, Li Y, ...&amp;, Lin X.

Common approaches include burden and non-burden tests. Burden tests assume all rare variants in the target region have effects on the phenotype in the same direction and of similar magnitude. The recently proposed sequence kernel association test (SKAT) (Wu, M. C., and others, 2011. Rare-variant association testing for sequencing data with the SKAT. The American Journal of Human Genetics 89, 82-93], an extension of the C-alpha test (Neale, B. M., and others, 2011. Testing for an unusual distribution of rare variants. PLoS Genetics 7, 161-165], provides a robust test that is particularly powerful in the presence of protective and deleterious variants and null variants, but is less powerful than burden tests when a large number of variants in a region are causal and in the same direction. As the underlying biological mechanisms are unknown in practice and vary from one gene to another across the genome, it is of substantial practical interest to develop a test that is optimal for both scenarios. In this paper, we propose a class of tests that include burden tests and SKAT as special cases, and derive an optimal test within this class that maximizes power. We show that this optimal test outperforms burden tests and SKAT in a wide range of scenarios. The results are illustrated using simulation studies and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study. In addition, we have derived sample size/power calculation formula for SKAT with a new family of kernels to facilitate designing new sequence association studies. </li> <li>CITATION : Lee S, Wu MC, Lin X.

We identified 157 genome-wide-significant loci and a polygenic architecture accounting for 57% of genetic variance in educational attainment. Noncognitive genetics were enriched in the same brain tissues and cell types as cognitive performance, but showed different associations with gray-matter brain volumes. Noncognitive genetics were further distinguished by associations with personality traits, less risky behavior and increased risk for certain psychiatric disorders. For socioeconomic success and longevity, noncognitive and cognitive-performance genetics demonstrated associations of similar magnitude.

Here, we show, through theory, simulations and applications to real data, that adjustment of GWAS analyses for polygenic scores (PGSs) increases the statistical power for discovery across all ancestries. We applied this method to analyze seven traits available in three large biobanks with participants of East Asian ancestry (n = 340,000 in total) and report 139 additional associations across traits. We also present a two-stage meta-analysis strategy whereby, in contributing cohorts, a PGS-adjusted GWAS is rerun using PGSs derived from a first round of a standard meta-analysis. On average, across traits, this approach yields a 1.26-fold increase in the number of detected associations (range 1.07- to 1.76-fold increase). Altogether, our study demonstrates the value of using PGSs to increase the power of GWASs in underrepresented populations and promotes such an analytical strategy for future GWAS meta-analyses. </li> <li>CITATION : Campos AI, Namba S, Lin SC, Nam K, ...&amp;, Yengo L.

All existing methods require time cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an infinitesimal genetic architecture in which effect sizes are normally distributed, which can limit power. Here we present a far more efficient mixed-model association method, BOLT-LMM, which requires only a small number of O(MN) time iterations and increases power by modeling more realistic, non-infinitesimal genetic architectures via a Bayesian mixture prior on marker effect sizes. We applied BOLT-LMM to 9 quantitative traits in 23,294 samples from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS) and observed significant increases in power, consistent with simulations. Theory and simulations show that the boost in power increases with cohort size, making BOLT-LMM appealing for genome-wide association studies in large cohorts. </li> <li>CITATION : Loh PR, Tucker G, Bulik-Sullivan BK, Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ, ...&amp;, Price AL.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Purcell S, Neale B, Todd-Brown K, Thomas L, ...&amp;, Sham PC.

However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. FINDINGS: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use. </li> <li>CITATION : Chang CC, Chow CC, Tellier LC, Vattikuti S, ...&amp;, Lee JJ.

However, because of the lack of analysis tools, methods designed for binary or quantitative traits are commonly used inappropriately to analyze categorical phenotypes. To accurately model the dependence of an ordinal categorical phenotype on covariates, we propose an efficient mixed model association test, proportional odds logistic mixed model (POLMM). POLMM is computationally efficient to analyze large datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples, can control type I error rates at a stringent significance level regardless of the phenotypic distribution, and is more powerful than alternative methods. In contrast, the standard linear mixed model approaches cannot control type I error rates for rare variants when the phenotypic distribution is unbalanced, although they performed well when testing common variants. We applied POLMM to 258 ordinal categorical phenotypes on array genotypes and imputed samples from 408,961 individuals in UK Biobank. In total, we identified 5,885 genome-wide significant variants, of which, 424 variants (7.2%) are rare variants with MAF &lt; 0.01. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Bi W, Zhou W, Dey R, Mukherjee B, ...&amp;, Lee S.

Conventional GWAS for quantitative traits are based on simplified regression models modeling the conditional mean of a phenotype as a linear function of genotype. We draw attention here to an alternative, lesser known approach, namely quantile regression that naturally extends linear regression to the analysis of the entire conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. Quantile regression can be applied efficiently at biobank scale, while having some unique advantages such as (1) identifying variants with heterogeneous effects across quantiles of the phenotype distribution; (2) accommodating a wide range of phenotype distributions including non-normal distributions, with invariance of results to trait transformations; and (3) providing more detailed information about genotype-phenotype associations even for those associations identified by conventional GWAS. We show in simulations that quantile regression is powerful across both homogeneous and various heterogeneous models. Applications to 39 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank demonstrate that quantile regression can be a helpful complement to linear regression in GWAS and can identify variants with larger effects on high-risk subgroups of individuals but with lower or no contribution overall. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Wang C, Wang T, Kiryluk K, Wei Y, ...&amp;, Ionita-Laza I.

The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test for unbalanced case-control phenotypes.

Two major confounding factors, population stratification and relatedness, could potentially lead to inflated GWAS test statistics and hence to spurious associations. Mixed linear model (MLM)-based approaches can be used to account for sample structure. However, genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in biobank samples such as the UK Biobank (UKB) often exceed the capability of most existing MLM-based tools especially if the number of traits is large. Here, we develop an MLM-based tool (fastGWA) that controls for population stratification by principal components and for relatedness by a sparse genetic relationship matrix for GWA analyses of biobank-scale data. We demonstrate by extensive simulations that fastGWA is reliable, robust and highly resource-efficient. We then apply fastGWA to 2,173 traits on array-genotyped and imputed samples from 456,422 individuals and to 2,048 traits on whole-exome-sequenced samples from 46,191 individuals in the UKB. </li> <li>CITATION : Jiang L, Zheng Z, Qi T, Kemper KE, ...&amp;, Yang J.

In the present study, leveraging efficient sparse matrix-based algorithms, we developed a GLMM-based GWA tool, fastGWA-GLMM, that is severalfold to orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art tools when applied to the UK Biobank (UKB) data and scalable to cohorts with millions of individuals. We show by simulation that the fastGWA-GLMM test statistics of both common and rare variants are well calibrated under the null, even for traits with extreme case-control ratios. We applied fastGWA-GLMM to the UKB data of 456,348 individuals, 11,842,647 variants and 2,989 binary traits (full summary statistics available at http://fastgwa.info/ukbimpbin ), and identified 259 rare variants associated with 75 traits, demonstrating the use of imputed genotype data in a large cohort to discover rare variants for binary complex traits. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Jiang L, Zheng Z, Fang H, Yang J.

Here we used 406 cancer ATAC-Seq samples across 23 cancer types to identify 7,262 germline allele-specific accessibility QTLs (as-aQTLs). Cancer as-aQTLs had stronger enrichment for cancer risk heritability (up to 145 fold) than any other functional annotation across seven cancer GWAS. Most cancer as-aQTLs directly altered transcription factor (TF) motifs and exhibited differential TF binding and gene expression in functional screens. To connect as-aQTLs to putative risk mechanisms, we introduced the regulome-wide associations study (RWAS). RWAS identified genetically associated accessible peaks at &gt;70% of known breast and prostate loci and discovered new risk loci in all examined cancer types. Integrating as-aQTL discovery, motif analysis and RWAS identified candidate causal regulatory elements and their probable upstream regulators. Our work establishes cancer as-aQTLs and RWAS analysis as powerful tools to study the genetic architecture of cancer risk. </li> <li>CITATION : Grishin D, Gusev A.

We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height).

Gene-level association methods such as PrediXcan can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method (MultiXcan) that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. MultiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure. We apply our method to simulated and real traits from the UK Biobank and show that, in realistic settings, we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed a summary result-based extension called S-MultiXcan, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version when LD is well matched. Our multivariate model-based approach allowed us to use the individual level results as a gold standard to calibrate and develop a robust implementation of the summary-based extension. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Barbeira AN, Pividori M, Zheng J, Wheeler HE, ...&amp;, Im HK.

We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments.

We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms.

Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted expression between pairs of traits. We integrated gene expression measurements from 45 expression panels with summary GWAS data to perform 30 multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs). We identified 1,196 genes whose expression is associated with these traits; of these, 168 reside more than 0.5 Mb away from any previously reported GWAS significant variant. We then used our approach to find 43 pairs of traits with significant genetic correlation at the level of predicted expression; of these, eight were not found through genetic correlation at the SNP level. Finally, we used bi-directional regression to find evidence that BMI causally influences triglyceride levels and that triglyceride levels causally influence low-density lipoprotein. Together, our results provide insight into the role of gene expression in the susceptibility of complex traits and diseases. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Mancuso N, Shi H, Goddard P, Kichaev G, ...&amp;, Pasaniuc B.

These methods, including colocalization, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and Mendelian randomization-based methods; however, all suffer from a key problem-when assessing the role of a gene in a trait using its eQTLs, nearby variants and genetic components of other genes' expression may be correlated with these eQTLs and have direct effects on the trait, acting as potential confounders. Our extensive simulations showed that existing methods fail to account for these 'genetic confounders', resulting in severe inflation of false positives. Our new method, causal-TWAS (cTWAS), borrows ideas from statistical fine-mapping and allows us to adjust all genetic confounders. cTWAS showed calibrated false discovery rates in simulations, and its application on several common traits discovered new candidate genes.

However, there are currently no resources providing a comprehensive listing of gene-disease associations discovered by TWAS from published GWAS summary statistics. TWAS analyses are also difficult to conduct due to the complexity of TWAS software pipelines. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource called webTWAS, which integrates a database of the most comprehensive disease GWAS datasets currently available with credible sets of potential causal genes identified by multiple TWAS software packages. Specifically, a total of 235 064 gene-diseases associations for a wide range of human diseases are prioritized from 1298 high-quality downloadable European GWAS summary statistics. Associations are calculated with seven different statistical models based on three popular and representative TWAS software packages. Users can explore associations at the gene or disease level, and easily search for related studies or diseases using the MeSH disease tree. Since the effects of diseases are highly tissue-specific, webTWAS applies tissue-specific enrichment analysis to identify significant tissues. A user-friendly web server is also available to run custom TWAS analyses on user-provided GWAS summary statistics data. webTWAS is freely available at http://www.webtwas.net. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Cao C, Wang J, Kwok D, Cui F, ...&amp;, Zou Q.

For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for eQTL analysis grows stronger. RESULTS: We have developed a new software for computationally efficient eQTL analysis called Matrix eQTL. In tests on large datasets, it was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for QTL/eQTL analysis, while finding the same eQTLs. The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-eQTLs. </li> <li>CITATION : Shabalin AA.

We present RASQUAL (Robust Allele-Specific Quantitation and Quality Control), a new statistical approach for association mapping that models genetic effects and accounts for biases in sequencing data using a single, probabilistic framework. RASQUAL substantially improves fine-mapping accuracy and sensitivity relative to existing methods in RNA-seq, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximize association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,707 independent caQTLs (at a false discovery rate of 10%) and demonstrated how RASQUAL and ATAC-seq can provide powerful information for fine-mapping gene-regulatory variants and for linking distal regulatory elements with gene promoters. Our results highlight how combining between-individual and allele-specific genetic signals improves the functional interpretation of noncoding variation. </li> <li>CITATION : Kumasaka N, Knights AJ, Gaffney DJ.

It is desirable to model both genetic and parent-of-origin effects simultaneously to avoid confounding and to improve the power to detect either effect. In studies of genetically tractable model organisms, separation of genetic and parent-of-origin effects can be achieved by studying reciprocal cross of two inbred strains. In contrast, this task is much more challenging in outbred populations such as humans. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework to combine experimental strategies and novel statistical methods. Specifically, we propose to study genetic and imprinting effects in family trios with RNA-seq data from the children and genotype data from both parents and children, and quantify genetic effects by cis-eQTLs. Towards this end, we have extended our method that studies the eQTLs of RNA-seq data (Sun, Biometrics 2012, 68(1): 1-11) to model both cis-eQTL and parent-of-origin effects, and evaluated its performance using extensive simulations. Since sample size may be limited in family trios, we have developed a data analysis pipeline that borrows information from external data of unrelated individuals for cis-eQTL mapping. We have also collected RNA-seq data from the children of 30 family trios, applied our method to analyze this dataset, and identified some previously reported imprinted genes as well as some new candidates of imprinted genes. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor </li> <li>CITATION : Zhabotynsky V, Inoue K, Magnuson T, Mauro Calabrese J, ...&amp;, Sun W.

Our approach obviates the need for transcript annotations and circumvents the challenges in estimating relative isoform or exon usage in complex splicing events. LeafCutter can be used both to detect differential splicing between sample groups and to map splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs). Compared with contemporary methods, our approach identified 1.4-2.1 times more sQTLs, many of which helped us ascribe molecular effects to disease-associated variants. Transcriptome-wide associations between LeafCutter intron quantifications and 40 complex traits increased the number of associated disease genes at a 5% false discovery rate by an average of 2.1-fold compared with that detected through the use of gene expression levels alone.

Previous studies have shown considerable links of GWAS signals to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) but the links to other genetic regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), are underexplored. Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n = 2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P &lt; 5 \u00d7 10-8, approximately 61% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Qi T, Wu Y, Fang H, Zhang F, ...&amp;, Yang J.

We develop a statistical framework that uses a distance-based approach to compute the variability of splicing ratios across observations, and a non-parametric analogue to multivariate analysis of variance. We implement this approach in the R package sQTLseekeR and use it to analyze RNA-Seq data from the Geuvadis project in 465 individuals. We identify hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), including some falling in genome-wide association study SNPs.

For variants which impact a specific protein, this can help identify additional therapeutic indications or on-target side effects of intervening on that protein. However, PheWAS is restricted by an inability to distinguish confounding due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) from true pleiotropy. Here we describe CoPheScan (Coloc adapted Phenome-wide Scan), a Bayesian approach that enables an intuitive and systematic exploration of causal associations while simultaneously addressing LD confounding. We demonstrate its performance through simulation, showing considerably better control of false positive rates than a conventional approach not accounting for LD. We used CoPheScan to perform PheWAS of protein-truncating variants and fine-mapped variants from disease and pQTL studies, in 2275 disease phenotypes from the UK Biobank. Our results identify the complexity of known pleiotropic genes such as APOE, and suggest a new causal role for TGM3 in skin cancer. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Manipur I, Reales G, Sul JH, Shin MK, ...&amp;, Wallace C.

The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including &gt;100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways. </li> <li>CITATION : Giambartolomei C, Vukcevic D, Schadt EE, Franke L, ...&amp;, Plagnol V.

It has also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend that coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Wallace C.

The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation for multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 s). We perform a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits, identifying 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with \u22651 trait, including 5 previously unknown CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrate gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes. </li> <li>CITATION : Foley CN, Staley JR, Breen PG, Sun BB, ...&amp;, Howson JMM.

One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual's disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present eCAVIAR, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that eCAVIAR can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Hormozdiari F, van de Bunt M, Segr\u00e8 AV, Li X, ...&amp;, Eskin E.

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the \"missing heritability\" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets. </li> <li>CITATION : Yang J, Lee SH, Goddard ME, Visscher PM.

Although these approaches require information about the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between variants, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of how estimation of the LD structure from reference genotype panels performs in comparison with that from the original individual-level GWAS data. Using population genotype data from Finland and the UK Biobank, we show here that a reference panel of 1,000 individuals from the target population is adequate for a GWAS cohort of up to 10,000 individuals, whereas smaller panels, such as those from the 1000 Genomes Project, should be avoided. We also show, both theoretically and empirically, that the size of the reference panel needs to scale with the GWAS sample size; this has important consequences for the application of these methods in ongoing GWAS meta-analyses and large biobank studies. We conclude by providing software tools and by recommending practices for sharing LD information to more efficiently exploit summary statistics in genetics research. </li> <li>CITATION : Benner C, Havulinna AS, J\u00e4rvelin MR, Salomaa V, ...&amp;, Pirinen M.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Purcell S, Neale B, Todd-Brown K, Thomas L, ...&amp;, Sham PC.

However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. FINDINGS: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility.

We show that this chi2 test can have inflated type I error rates, even in relatively large samples (e.g., samples of 1,000 individuals that include approximately 100 copies of the minor allele). On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation. Our methods adequately control type I error in large and small samples and are computationally efficient. They have been implemented in freely available code that will be useful for quality assessment of genotype data and for the detection of genetic association or population stratification in very large data sets. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Wigginton JE, Cutler DJ, Abecasis GR.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Purcell S, Neale B, Todd-Brown K, Thomas L, ...&amp;, Sham PC.

However, feature selection is challenging when this low-rank structure manifests from a sparse subspace. We introduce SuSiE PCA, a scalable sparse latent factor approach that evaluates uncertainty in contributing variables through posterior inclusion probabilities. We validate our model in extensive simulations and demonstrate that SuSiE PCA outperforms other approaches in signal detection and model robustness. We apply SuSiE PCA to multi-tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data from GTEx v8 and identify tissue-specific factors and their contributing eGenes. We further investigate its performance on the large-scale perturbation data and find that SuSiE PCA identifies modules with a higher enrichment of ribosome-related genes than sparse PCA (false discovery rate [FDR] =9.2\u00d710-82 vs. 1.4\u00d710-33), while being \u223c 18x faster.

Individual methodologies complementarily prioritized drugs and drug targets, which were systematically validated by referring previously known drug-disease relationships. Integration of the three methodologies provided a comprehensive catalog of candidate drugs for repositioning, nominating promising drug candidates targeting the genes involved in the coagulation process for venous thromboembolism and the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling pathway for gout.

We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease-disease and disease-molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio = 8.1, 95% confidence interval = 5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal ( http://genetics.opentargets.org ), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets. </li> <li>CITATION : Mountjoy E, Schmidt EM, Carmona M, Schwartzentruber J, ...&amp;, Ghoussaini M.

While PRS has some predictive utility, it lacks the molecular specificity to be directly informative for clinical interventions. We therefore sought to develop a framework to quantify an individual's common variant enrichment in clinically actionable systems responsive to existing drugs. This was achieved with a metric designated the pharmagenic enrichment score (PES), which we demonstrate for individual SNP profiles in a cohort of cases with schizophrenia. A large proportion of these had elevated PES in one or more of eight clinically actionable gene-sets enriched with schizophrenia associated common variation. Notable candidates targeting these pathways included vitamins, antioxidants, insulin modulating agents, and cholinergic drugs. Interestingly, elevated PES was also observed in individuals with otherwise low common variant burden. The biological saliency of PES profiles were observed directly through their impact on gene expression in a subset of the cohort with matched transcriptomic data, supporting our assertion that this gene-set orientated approach could integrate an individual's common variant risk to inform personalised interventions, including drug repositioning, for complex disorders such as schizophrenia. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Reay WR, Atkins JR, Carr VJ, Green MJ, ...&amp;, Cairns MJ.

While numerous existing methods focus on the integration of heterogeneous data to propose candidate drugs, it is still challenging to substantiate their results with mechanistic insights of these candidate drugs. Therefore, there is a need for more innovative and efficient methods which can enable better integration of data and knowledge for drug repositioning. RESULTS: Here, we present a customizable workflow (PS4DR) which not only integrates high-throughput data such as genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and gene expression signatures from disease and drug perturbations but also takes pathway knowledge into consideration to predict drug candidates for repositioning. We have collected and integrated publicly available GWAS data and gene expression signatures for several diseases and hundreds of FDA-approved drugs or those under clinical trial in this study. Additionally, different pathway databases were used for mechanistic knowledge integration in the workflow. Using this systematic consolidation of data and knowledge, the workflow computes pathway signatures that assist in the prediction of new indications for approved and investigational drugs. CONCLUSION: We showcase PS4DR with applications demonstrating how this tool can be used for repositioning and identifying new drugs as well as proposing drugs that can simulate disease dysregulations. We were able to validate our workflow by demonstrating its capability to predict FDA-approved drugs for their known indications for several diseases. Further, PS4DR returned many potential drug candidates for repositioning that were backed up by epidemiological evidence extracted from scientific literature.

Drug targets with genetic support are more likely to be therapeutically valid2,3, but the translational use of genome-scale data such as from genome-wide association studies for drug target discovery in complex diseases remains challenging4-6. Here, we show that integration of functional genomic and immune-related annotations, together with knowledge of network connectivity, maximizes the informativeness of genetics for target validation, defining the target prioritization landscape for 30 immune traits at the gene and pathway level. We demonstrate how our genetics-led drug target prioritization approach (the priority index) successfully identifies current therapeutics, predicts activity in high-throughput cellular screens (including L1000, CRISPR, mutagenesis and patient-derived cell assays), enables prioritization of under-explored targets and allows for determination of target-level trait relationships. The priority index is an open-access, scalable system accelerating early-stage drug target selection for immune-mediated disease. </li> <li>CITATION : Fang H, ULTRA-DD Consortium, De Wolf H, Knezevic B, ...&amp;, Knight JC.

Despite large efforts to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across many human tissues, our ability to translate those findings to understanding human disease has been incomplete, and the majority of disease loci are not explained by association with expression of a target gene. Cell-type specificity and the presence of multiple independent causal variants for many eQTLs are potential confounders contributing to the apparent discrepancy with disease loci. In this study, we investigate the tissue specificity of genetic effects on gene expression and the overlap with disease loci while considering the presence of multiple causal variants within and across tissues. We find evidence of pervasive tissue specificity of eQTLs, often masked by linkage disequilibrium that misleads traditional meta-analytic approaches. We propose CAFEH (colocalization and fine-mapping in the presence of allelic heterogeneity), a Bayesian method that integrates genetic association data across multiple traits, incorporating linkage disequilibrium to identify causal variants. CAFEH outperforms previous approaches in colocalization and fine-mapping. Using CAFEH, we show that genes with highly tissue-specific genetic effects are under greater selection, enriched in differentiation and developmental processes, and more likely to be involved in human disease. Last, we demonstrate that CAFEH can efficiently leverage the widespread allelic heterogeneity in genetic regulation of gene expression to prioritize the target tissue in genome-wide association complex trait loci, thereby improving our ability to interpret complex trait genetics. </li> <li>CITATION : Arvanitis M, Tayeb K, Strober BJ, Battle A.

Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of the association signal in an iterative conditioning framework or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus, which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical framework that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g., 95%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20-50% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from an expression QTL study of CHI3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus.

They also have the advantage of using only the marginal test statistics and the correlation among SNPs. Both methods leverage the fact that the marginal test statistics asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution and are likelihood based. However, their relationship with Bayesian fine mapping, such as BIMBAM, is not clear. In this study, we first show that CAVIAR and BIMBAM are actually approximately equivalent to each other. This leads to a fine-mapping method using marginal test statistics in the Bayesian framework, which we call CAVIAR Bayes factor (CAVIARBF). Another advantage of the Bayesian framework is that it can answer both association and fine-mapping questions. We also used simulations to compare CAVIARBF with other methods under different numbers of causal variants. The results showed that both CAVIARBF and BIMBAM have better performance than PAINTOR and other methods. Compared to BIMBAM, CAVIARBF has the advantage of using only marginal test statistics and takes about one-quarter to one-fifth of the running time. We applied different methods on two independent cohorts of the same phenotype. Results showed that CAVIARBF, BIMBAM, and PAINTOR selected the same top 3 SNPs; however, CAVIARBF and BIMBAM had better consistency in selecting the top 10 ranked SNPs between the two cohorts.

Typically, however, variants are only analysed one-at-a-time. This complicates the ability of fine-mapping to identify a small set of SNPs for further functional follow-up. We describe a new and scalable algorithm, joint analysis of marginal summary statistics (JAM), for the re-analysis of published marginal summary stactistics under joint multi-SNP models. The correlation is accounted for according to estimates from a reference dataset, and models and SNPs that best explain the complete joint pattern of marginal effects are highlighted via an integrated Bayesian penalized regression framework. We provide both enumerated and Reversible Jump MCMC implementations of JAM and present some comparisons of performance. In a series of realistic simulation studies, JAM demonstrated identical performance to various alternatives designed for single region settings. In multi-region settings, where the only multivariate alternative involves stepwise selection, JAM offered greater power and specificity. We also present an application to real published results from MAGIC (meta-analysis of glucose and insulin related traits consortium) - a GWAS meta-analysis of more than 15,000 people. We re-analysed several genomic regions that produced multiple significant signals with glucose levels 2 hr after oral stimulation. Through joint multivariate modelling, JAM was able to formally rule out many SNPs, and for one gene, ADCY5, suggests that an additional SNP, which transpired to be more biologically plausible, should be followed up with equal priority to the reported index. </li> <li>CITATION : Newcombe PJ, Conti DV, Richardson S.

However, heterogeneity in allelic effects between GWAS at these loci can occur that is correlated with ancestry. Here, a novel approach is presented to detect SNP association and quantify the extent of heterogeneity in allelic effects that is correlated with ancestry. We employ trans-ethnic meta-regression to model allelic effects as a function of axes of genetic variation, derived from a matrix of mean pairwise allele frequency differences between GWAS, and implemented in the MR-MEGA software. Through detailed simulations, we demonstrate increased power to detect association for MR-MEGA over fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis across a range of scenarios of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups. We also demonstrate improved fine-mapping resolution, in loci containing a single causal variant, compared to these meta-analysis approaches and PAINTOR, and equivalent performance to MANTRA at reduced computational cost. Application of MR-MEGA to trans-ethnic GWAS of kidney function in 71,461 individuals indicates stronger signals of association than fixed-effects meta-analysis when heterogeneity in allelic effects is correlated with ancestry. Application of MR-MEGA to fine-mapping four type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in 22,086 cases and 42,539 controls highlights: (i) strong evidence for heterogeneity in allelic effects that is correlated with ancestry only at the index SNP for the association signal at the CDKAL1 locus; and (ii) 99% credible sets with six or fewer variants for five distinct association signals. </li> <li>CITATION : M\u00e4gi R, Horikoshi M, Sofer T, Mahajan A, ...&amp;, Morris AP.

Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90% of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits.

Bayesian fine-mapping algorithms (for example, SuSiE, FINEMAP, ABF and COJO-ABF) are widely used, but assessing posterior probability calibration remains challenging in real data, where model misspecification probably exists, and true causal variants are unknown. We introduce replication failure rate (RFR), a metric to assess fine-mapping consistency by downsampling. SuSiE, FINEMAP and COJO-ABF show high RFR, indicating potential overconfidence in their output. Simulations reveal that nonsparse genetic architecture can lead to miscalibration, while imputation noise, nonuniform distribution of causal variants and quality control filters have minimal impact. Here we present SuSiE-inf and FINEMAP-inf, fine-mapping methods modeling infinitesimal effects alongside fewer larger causal effects. Our methods show improved calibration, RFR and functional enrichment, competitive recall and computational efficiency. Notably, using our methods' posterior effect sizes substantially increases polygenic risk score accuracy over SuSiE and FINEMAP. Our work improves causal variant identification for complex traits, a fundamental goal of human genetics. </li> <li>CITATION : Cui R, Elzur RA, Kanai M, Ulirsch JC, ...&amp;, Finucane HK.

The approach is based on a new model - the \"Sum of Single Effects\" (SuSiE) model - which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of \"single-effect\" vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure - Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) - which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and illustrate their application to fine-mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Wang G, Sarkar A, Carbonetto P, Stephens M.

Here we present new methods for fitting the SuSiE model to summary data, for example to single-SNP z-scores from an association study and linkage disequilibrium (LD) values estimated from a suitable reference panel. To develop these new methods, we first describe a simple, generic strategy for extending any individual-level data method to deal with summary data. The key idea is to replace the usual regression likelihood with an analogous likelihood based on summary data. We show that existing fine-mapping methods such as FINEMAP and CAVIAR also (implicitly) use this strategy, but in different ways, and so this provides a common framework for understanding different methods for fine-mapping. We investigate other common practical issues in fine-mapping with summary data, including problems caused by inconsistencies between the z-scores and LD estimates, and we develop diagnostics to identify these inconsistencies. We also present a new refinement procedure that improves model fits in some data sets, and hence improves overall reliability of the SuSiE fine-mapping results. Detailed evaluations of fine-mapping methods in a range of simulated data sets show that SuSiE applied to summary data is competitive, in both speed and accuracy, with the best available fine-mapping methods for summary data. </li> <li>CITATION : Zou Y, Carbonetto P, Wang G, Stephens M.

Functional annotations of the genome may help to prioritize variants that are biologically relevant and thus improve fine-mapping of GWAS results. Classical fine-mapping methods conducting an exhaustive search of variant-level causal configurations have a high computational cost, especially when the underlying genetic architecture and LD patterns are complex. SuSiE provided an iterative Bayesian stepwise selection algorithm for efficient fine-mapping. In this work, we build connections between SuSiE and a paired mean field variational inference algorithm through the implementation of a sparse projection, and propose effective strategies for estimating hyperparameters and summarizing posterior probabilities. Moreover, we incorporate functional annotations into fine-mapping by jointly estimating enrichment weights to derive functionally-informed priors. We evaluate the performance of SparsePro through extensive simulations using resources from the UK Biobank. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SparsePro achieved improved power for fine-mapping with reduced computation time. We demonstrate the utility of SparsePro through fine-mapping of five functional biomarkers of clinically relevant phenotypes. In summary, we have developed an efficient fine-mapping method for integrating summary statistics and functional annotations. Our method can have wide utility in understanding the genetics of complex traits and increasing the yield of functional follow-up studies of GWAS.

Using a large evaluation set of genes with fine-mapped coding variants, we show that PoPS and the closest gene individually outperform other gene prioritization methods, but observe the best overall performance by combining PoPS with orthogonal methods. Using this combined approach, we prioritize 10,642 unique gene-trait pairs across 113 complex traits and diseases with high precision, finding not only well-established gene-trait relationships but nominating new genes at unresolved loci, such as LGR4 for estimated glomerular filtration rate and CCR7 for deep vein thrombosis.

Many SNP-to-gene (S2G) linking strategies have been developed to link regulatory SNPs to the genes that they regulate in cis. Here, we developed a heritability-based framework for evaluating and combining different S2G strategies to optimize their informativeness for common disease risk. Our optimal combined S2G strategy (cS2G) included seven constituent S2G strategies and achieved a precision of 0.75 and a recall of 0.33, more than doubling the recall of any individual strategy. We applied cS2G to fine-mapping results for 49 UK Biobank diseases/traits to predict 5,095 causal SNP-gene-disease triplets (with S2G-derived functional interpretation) with high confidence. We further applied cS2G to provide an empirical assessment of disease omnigenicity; we determined that the top 1% of genes explained roughly half of the SNP heritability linked to all genes and that gene-level architectures vary with variant allele frequency. </li> <li>CITATION : Gazal S, Weissbrod O, Hormozdiari F, Dey KK, ...&amp;, Price AL.

Results from GWAS typically do not directly translate into causal variants because the majority of hits are in non-coding or intergenic regions, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium leads to effects being statistically spread out across multiple variants. Post-GWAS annotation facilitates the selection of most likely causal variant(s). Multiple resources are available for post-GWAS annotation, yet these can be time consuming and do not provide integrated visual aids for data interpretation. We, therefore, develop FUMA: an integrative web-based platform using information from multiple biological resources to facilitate functional annotation of GWAS results, gene prioritization and interactive visualization.

However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : de Leeuw CA, Mooij JM, Heskes T, Posthuma D.

We examined in particular the sum and the maximum of chi-squared statistics, which measure the strongest and the average association signals per gene, respectively. For pathway scoring, we use a modified Fisher method, which offers not only significant power improvement over more traditional enrichment strategies, but also eliminates the problem of arbitrary threshold selection inherent in any binary membership based pathway enrichment approach. We demonstrate the marked increase in power by analyzing summary statistics from dozens of large meta-studies for various traits. Our extensive testing indicates that our method not only excels in rigorous type I error control, but also results in more biologically meaningful discoveries. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Lamparter D, Marbach D, Rueedi R, Kutalik Z, ...&amp;, Bergmann S.

Two limitations of VEGAS were that the HapMap2 reference set was used to model the correlation between SNPs and only autosomal genes were considered. HapMap2 has now been superseded by the 1,000 Genomes reference set, and whereas early GWASs frequently ignored the X chromosome, it is now commonly included. Here we have developed VEGAS2, an extension that uses 1,000 Genomes data to model SNP correlations across the autosomes and chromosome X. VEGAS2 allows greater flexibility when defining gene boundaries. VEGAS2 offers both a user-friendly, web-based front end and a command line Linux version. The online version of VEGAS2 can be accessed through https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/. The command line version can be downloaded from https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/zVEGAS2offline.tgz.

However, single-allele association results published for many GWAS studies represent only the tip of the iceberg for the information that can be extracted from these datasets. The primary analysis strategy for GWAS entails association analysis in which only the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest p-values are declared statistically significant due to issues arising from multiple testing and type I errors. Factors such as locus heterogeneity, epistasis, and multiple genes conferring small effects contribute to the complexity of the genetic models underlying phenotype expression. Thus, many biologically meaningful associations having lower effect sizes at individual genes are overlooked, making it difficult to separate true associations from a sea of false-positive associations. Organizing these individual SNPs into biologically meaningful groups to look at the overall effects of minor perturbations to genes and pathways is desirable. This pathway-based approach provides researchers with insight into the functional foundations of the phenotype being studied and allows testing of various genetic scenarios. \u00a9 2018 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor </li> <li>CITATION : White MJ, Yaspan BL, Veatch OJ, Goddard P, ...&amp;, Contreras MG.

We use these methods to build genome-wide genealogies using genotyping data for 337,464 UK Biobank individuals and test for association across seven complex traits. Genealogy-based association detects more rare and ultra-rare signals (N = 134, frequency range 0.0007-0.1%) than genotype imputation using ~65,000 sequenced haplotypes (N = 64). In a subset of 138,039 exome sequencing samples, these associations strongly tag (average r = 0.72) underlying sequencing variants enriched (4.8\u00d7) for loss-of-function variation.

Unlike previous methods, which employ the Sequentially Markov Coalescent approximation, ARGinfer uses the Coalescent with Recombination, allowing more accurate inference of key evolutionary parameters. We show using simulations that ARGinfer can accurately estimate many properties of the evolutionary history of the sample, including the topology and branch lengths of the genealogical tree at each sequence site, and the times and locations of mutation and recombination events. ARGinfer approximates posterior probability distributions for these and other quantities, providing interpretable assessments of uncertainty that we show to be well calibrated.

However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes conditional on an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes, an operation we call \"threading.\" Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over ARGs and is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps. </li> <li>CITATION : Rasmussen MD, Hubisz MJ, Gronau I, Siepel A.

While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present a major extension of the ARGweaver algorithm, called ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topologies and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these regions. Finally, we predict that 1% of the Denisovan genome was introgressed from an unsequenced, but highly diverged, archaic hominin ancestor. About 15% of these \"super-archaic\" regions-comprising at least about 4Mb-were, in turn, introgressed into modern humans and continue to exist in the genomes of people alive today. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Hubisz MJ, Williams AL, Siepel A.

We present KwARG, which implements a parsimony-based greedy heuristic algorithm for finding plausible genealogical histories (ancestral recombination graphs) that are minimal or near-minimal in the number of posited recombination and mutation events. RESULTS: Given an input dataset of aligned sequences, KwARG outputs a list of possible candidate solutions, each comprising a list of mutation and recombination events that could have generated the dataset; the relative proportion of recombinations and recurrent mutations in a solution can be controlled via specifying a set of 'cost' parameters. We demonstrate that the algorithm performs well when compared against existing methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is available at https://github.com/a-ignatieva/kwarg.

Various studies have found evidence for a founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European populations, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters, and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size changes, we present a more detailed history of human population sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago, using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH), a Korean male (SJK), three European individuals (J. C. Venter, NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507 (ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese populations had very similar population-size histories before 10-20 kyr ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10-60 kyr ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, possibly due to population substructure. We also infer that the differentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early as 100-120 kyr ago, but considerable genetic exchanges may still have occurred until 20-40 kyr ago. </li> <li>CITATION : Li H, Durbin R.

If this shared genealogy can be inferred from haplotypes, it can be very useful for many population genetics problems. However, with the presence of recombination, the genealogical history of haplotypes is complex and cannot be represented by a single genealogical tree. Therefore, inference of genealogical history with recombination is much more challenging than the case of no recombination. Results: : In this paper, we present a new approach called RENT+ for the inference of local genealogical trees from haplotypes with the presence of recombination. RENT+ builds on a previous genealogy inference approach called RENT , which infers a set of related genealogical trees at different genomic positions. RENT+ represents a significant improvement over RENT in the sense that it is more effective in extracting information contained in the haplotype data about the underlying genealogy than RENT . The key components of RENT+ are several greatly enhanced genealogy inference rules. Through simulation, we show that RENT+ is more efficient and accurate than several existing genealogy inference methods. As an application, we apply RENT+ in the inference of population demographic history from haplotypes, which outperforms several existing methods.

Outside Africa, these mainly reflect ancient introgression from groups related to Neanderthals and Denisovans, while African signals instead reflect unknown events unique to that continent. Our approach allows more powerful inferences of natural selection than has previously been possible. We identify multiple regions under strong positive selection, and multi-allelic traits including hair color, body mass index and blood pressure, showing strong evidence of directional selection, varying among human groups. </li> <li>CITATION : Speidel L, Forest M, Shi S, Myers SR.

We then generate a genome-wide ancestral recombination graph including human and archaic hominin genomes. From this, we generate a map within human genomes of archaic ancestry and of genomic regions not shared with archaic hominins either by admixture or incomplete lineage sorting. We find that only 1.5 to 7% of the modern human genome is uniquely human. We also find evidence of multiple bursts of adaptive changes specific to modern humans within the past 600,000 years involving genes related to brain development and function. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Schaefer NK, Shapiro B, Green RE.

However, current methods are limited, and the most accurate techniques are able to process no more than a hundred samples. As datasets that consist of millions of genomes are now being collected, there is a need for scalable and efficient inference methods to fully utilize these resources. Here we introduce an algorithm that is able to not only infer whole-genome histories with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but also process four orders of magnitude more sequences. The approach also provides an 'evolutionary encoding' of the data, enabling efficient calculation of relevant statistics. We apply the method to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the inferred genealogies are rich in biological signal and efficient to process. </li> <li>CITATION : Kelleher J, Wong Y, Wohns AW, Fadil C, ...&amp;, McVean G.

The environment of an individual is inherently high dimensional, evolves through time and can be expensive and time consuming to measure. The UK Biobank study, with all 500 000 participants having undergone an extensive baseline questionnaire, represents a unique opportunity to assess GxE heritability for many traits and diseases in a well powered setting. RESULTS: We have developed a randomized Haseman-Elston non-linear regression method applicable when many environmental variables have been measured on each individual. The method (GPLEMMA) simultaneously estimates a linear environmental score (ES) and its GxE heritability. We compare the method via simulation to a whole-genome regression approach (LEMMA) for estimating GxE heritability. We show that GPLEMMA is more computationally efficient than LEMMA on large datasets, and produces results highly correlated with those from LEMMA when applied to simulated data and real data from the UK Biobank.

We propose a Bayesian whole-genome regression model for joint modeling of main genetic effects and GxE interactions in large-scale datasets, such as the UK Biobank, where many environmental variables have been measured. The method is called LEMMA (Linear Environment Mixed Model Analysis) and estimates a linear combination of environmental variables, called an environmental score (ES), that interacts with genetic markers throughout the genome. The ES provides a readily interpretable way to examine the combined effect of many environmental variables. The ES can be used both to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to GxE effects and to test for GxE effects at genetic variants across the genome. GxE effects can induce heteroskedasticity in quantitative traits, and LEMMA accounts for this by using robust standard error estimates when testing for GxE effects. When applied to body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure in the UK Biobank, we estimate that 9.3%, 3.9%, 1.6%, and 12.5%, respectively, of phenotypic variance is explained by GxE interactions and that low-frequency variants explain most of this variance. We also identify three loci that interact with the estimated environmental scores (-log10p&gt;7.3). </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Kerin M, Marchini J.

This overview presents a simple definition of gene-environment interaction and suggests study designs for detecting it. Gene-environment interaction is defined as \"a different effect of an environmental exposure on disease risk in persons with different genotypes,\" or, alternatively, \"a different effect of a genotype on disease risk in persons with different environmental exposures.\" Under this strictly statistical definition, the presence or absence of interaction depends upon the scale of measurement (additive or multiplicative). The decision of which scale is appropriate will be governed by many factors, including the main objective of an investigation (discovery of etiology, public health prediction, etc.) and the hypothesized pathophysiologic model. Five biologically plausible models are described for the relations between genotypes and environmental exposures, in terms of their effects on disease risk. Each of these models leads to a different set of predictions about disease risk in individuals classified by presence or absence of a high-risk genotype and environmental exposure. Classification according to the exposure is relatively easy, using conventional epidemiologic methods. Classification according to the high-risk genotype is more difficult, but several alternative strategies are suggested. </li> <li>CITATION : Ottman R.

Among the aims of such studies are testing developmental hypotheses and models of the etiology of behavioral disorders, defining boundaries of genetic and environmental influences, and identifying individuals most susceptible to risk exposures or most amenable to preventive and therapeutic interventions. This research also coincides with the emergence of unanticipated difficulties in detecting genetic variants of direct association with behavioral traits and disorders, which may be obscured if genetic effects are expressed only in predisposing environments.

Each approach has informed efforts to identify individuals who are either especially vulnerable to the negative effects of contextual adversity (diathesis stress) or especially susceptible to both positive and negative contextual conditions (differential susceptibility). A critical step in all such molecular G\u00d7E research is the selection of genetic variants thought to moderate environmental influences, a subject that has not received a great deal of attention in critiques of G\u00d7E research (beyond the observation of small effects of individual genes). Here we conceptually distinguish three phases of G\u00d7E work based on the selection of genes presumed to moderate environmental effects and the theoretical basis of such decisions: (a) single candidate genes, (b) composited (multiple) candidate genes, and (c) GWAS-derived polygenic scores. This illustrative, not exhaustive, review makes it clear that implicit or explicit theoretical assumptions inform gene selection in ways that have not been clearly articulated or fully appreciated. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhang X, Belsky J.

Such outcomes are affected by molecular, often epigenetic, processes involving gene-environment (G-E) interplay that can influence gene expression. Early environments with exposures to poverty, chronic adversities, and acutely stressful events have been linked to maladaptive development and compromised health and behavior. Genetic differences can impart either enhanced or blunted susceptibility to the effects of such pathogenic environments. However, largely missing from present discourse regarding G-E interplay is the role of time, a \"third factor\" guiding the emergence of complex developmental endpoints across different scales of time. Trajectories of development increasingly appear best accounted for by a complex, dynamic interchange among the highly linked elements of genes, contexts, and time at multiple scales, including neurobiological (minutes to milliseconds), genomic (hours to minutes), developmental (years and months), and evolutionary (centuries and millennia) time. This special issue of PNAS thus explores time and timing among G-E transactions: The importance of timing and timescales in plasticity and critical periods of brain development; epigenetics and the molecular underpinnings of biologically embedded experience; the encoding of experience across time and biological levels of organization; and gene-regulatory networks in behavior and development and their linkages to neuronal networks. Taken together, the collection of papers offers perspectives on how G-E interplay operates contingently within and against a backdrop of time and timescales. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtml </li> <li>CITATION : Boyce WT, Sokolowski MB, Robinson GE.

In many diseases, HLA explains more heritability than all other known loci combined. In silico HLA imputation methods enable rapid and accurate estimation of HLA alleles in the millions of individuals that are already genotyped on microarrays. HLA imputation has been used to define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and in human immunodeficiency virus infection control. However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation, association testing, and fine mapping. Here, we present a comprehensive tutorial to impute HLA alleles from genotype data. We provide detailed guidance on performing standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids either locally or using the web-based Michigan Imputation Server, which hosts a multi-ancestry HLA imputation reference panel. We also offer best practice recommendations to conduct association tests to define the alleles, amino acids, and haplotypes that affect human traits. Along with the pipeline, we provide a step-by-step online guide with scripts and available software ( https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA_analyses_tutorial ). This tutorial will be broadly applicable to large-scale genotyping data and will contribute to defining the role of HLA in human diseases across global populations. </li> <li>CITATION : Sakaue S, Gurajala S, Curtis M, Luo Y, ...&amp;, Raychaudhuri S.

We further identified multiple independent new susceptibility loci in HLA-C, HLA-B, HLA-DPB1 and BTNL2 and an intergenic variant, rs118179173, associated with psoriasis and confirmed the well-established risk allele HLA-C*06:02. We anticipate that our Han-MHC reference panel built by deep sequencing of a large number of samples will serve as a useful tool for investigating the role of the MHC region in a variety of diseases and thus advance understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhou F, Cao H, Zuo X, Zhang T, ...&amp;, Zhang X.

Through validation using the Japanese and European HLA reference panels (n = 1,118 and 5,122), DEEPHLA achieves the highest accuracies with significant superiority for low-frequency and rare alleles. DEEPHLA is less dependent on distance-dependent linkage disequilibrium decay of the target alleles and might capture the complicated region-wide information. We apply DEEPHLA to type 1 diabetes GWAS data from BioBank Japan (n = 62,387) and UK Biobank (n = 354,459), and successfully disentangle independently associated class I and II HLA variants with shared risk among diverse populations (the top signal at amino acid position 71 of HLA-DR\u03b21; P = 7.5 \u00d7 10-120).

However, deriving high-resolution HLA types subsequent to whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing or sequencing is often cost prohibitive for large samples. An alternative approach takes advantage of the extended haplotype structure within the MHC to predict HLA alleles using dense SNP genotypes, such as those available from genome-wide SNP panels. Current methods for HLA imputation are difficult to apply or may require the user to have access to large training data sets with SNP and HLA types. We propose HIBAG, HLA Imputation using attribute BAGging, that makes predictions by averaging HLA-type posterior probabilities over an ensemble of classifiers built on bootstrap samples. We assess the performance of HIBAG using our study data (n=2668 subjects of European ancestry) as a training set and HLA data from the British 1958 birth cohort study (n\u22481000 subjects) as independent validation samples. Prediction accuracies for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 range from 92.2% to 98.1% using a set of SNP markers common to the Illumina 1M Duo, OmniQuad, OmniExpress, 660K and 550K platforms. HIBAG performed well compared with the other two leading methods, HLA*IMP and BEAGLE. This method is implemented in a freely available HIBAG R package that includes pre-fit classifiers for European, Asian, Hispanic and African ancestries, providing a readily available imputation approach without the need to have access to large training data sets. </li> <li>CITATION : Zheng X, Shen J, Cox C, Wakefield JC, ...&amp;, Weir BS.

The complex genetic structure of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) makes it difficult, however, to collect genotyping data in large cohorts. Long-range linkage disequilibrium between HLA loci and SNP markers across the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region offers an alternative approach through imputation to interrogate HLA variation in existing GWAS data sets. Here we describe a computational strategy, SNP2HLA, to impute classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms at class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1) loci. To characterize performance of SNP2HLA, we constructed two European ancestry reference panels, one based on data collected in HapMap-CEPH pedigrees (90 individuals) and another based on data collected by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC, 5,225 individuals). We imputed HLA alleles in an independent data set from the British 1958 Birth Cohort (N = 918) with gold standard four-digit HLA types and SNPs genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K and Illumina Immunochip microarrays. We demonstrate that the sample size of the reference panel, rather than SNP density of the genotyping platform, is critical to achieve high imputation accuracy. Using the larger T1DGC reference panel, the average accuracy at four-digit resolution is 94.7% using the low-density Affymetrix GeneChip 500 K, and 96.7% using the high-density Illumina Immunochip.

We determine that squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation is 0.82\u00d7 (s.e. 0.01) depleted in the top quintile of background selection statistic, implying more population-specific causal effect sizes. Accordingly, causal effect sizes are more population-specific in functionally important regions, including conserved and regulatory regions. In regions surrounding specifically expressed genes, causal effect sizes are most population-specific for skin and immune genes, and least population-specific for brain genes.

The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual-level genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique-cross-trait LD Score regression-for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity, and educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, as there currently are no significantly associated SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment. </li> <li>CITATION : Bulik-Sullivan B, Finucane HK, Anttila V, Gusev A, ...&amp;, Neale BM.

Up to 24% of all cis and coding regions of each chromosome are associated with each trait, with over 3,100 independent exonic and intronic regions and over 5,400 independent regulatory regions having \u226595% probability of contributing \u22650.001% to the genetic variance of these four traits.

Traditionally, genetic correlations between complex traits are estimated from pedigree studies, but such estimates can be confounded by shared environmental factors. Moreover, for diseases, low prevalence rates imply that even if the true genetic correlation between disorders was high, co-aggregation of disorders in families might not occur or could not be distinguished from chance. We have developed and implemented statistical methods based on linear mixed models to obtain unbiased estimates of the genetic correlation between pairs of quantitative traits or pairs of binary traits of complex diseases using population-based case-control studies with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. The method is validated in a simulation study and applied to estimate genetic correlation between various diseases from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data in a series of bivariate analyses. We estimate a significant positive genetic correlation between risk of Type 2 diabetes and hypertension of ~0.31 (SE 0.14, P = 0.024).

We demonstrate using simulations based on whole-genome sequencing data that \u223c97% and \u223c68% of variation at common and rare variants, respectively, can be captured by imputation. Using the GREML-LDMS method, we estimate from 44,126 unrelated individuals that all \u223c17 million imputed variants explain 56% (standard error (s.e.) = 2.3%) of variance for height and 27% (s.e. = 2.5%) of variance for body mass index (BMI), and we find evidence that height- and BMI-associated variants have been under natural selection. Considering the imperfect tagging of imputation and potential overestimation of heritability from previous family-based studies, heritability is likely to be 60-70% for height and 30-40% for BMI. Therefore, the missing heritability is small for both traits. For further discovery of genes associated with complex traits, a study design with SNP arrays followed by imputation is more cost-effective than whole-genome sequencing at current prices. </li> <li>CITATION : Yang J, Bakshi A, Zhu Z, Hemani G, ...&amp;, Visscher PM.

Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests.

Compared to LDSC, HDL reduces the variance of genetic correlation estimates by about 60%, equivalent to a 2.5-fold increase in sample size. We apply HDL and LDSC to estimate 435 genetic correlations among 30 behavioral and disease-related phenotypes measured in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In addition to 154 significant genetic correlations observed for both methods, HDL identified another 57 significant genetic correlations, compared to only another 2 significant genetic correlations identified by LDSC. HDL brings more power to genomic analyses and better reveals the underlying connections across human complex traits. </li> <li>CITATION : Ning Z, Pawitan Y, Shen X.

With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the ~300,000 SNPs on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5%-10% can be explained by SNPs reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in SNP-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high LD and are underestimated in regions of low LD. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which SNPs are weighted according to local LD. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our LD adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high LD in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed LDAK, software for computing LD-adjusted kinships. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Speed D, Hemani G, Johnson MR, Balding DJ.

The key difference between SumHer and the existing software LD Score Regression (LDSC) is that SumHer allows the user to specify the heritability model. We apply SumHer to results from 24 large-scale association studies (average sample size 121,000) using our recommended heritability model. We show that these studies tended to substantially over-correct for confounding, and as a result the number of genome-wide significant loci was under-reported by about a quarter. We also estimate enrichments for 24 categories of SNPs defined by functional annotations. A previous study using LDSC reported that conserved regions were 13-fold enriched, and found a further six categories with above threefold enrichment. By contrast, our analysis using SumHer finds that none of the categories have enrichment above twofold.

Jointly modeling multiple traits' genetic profiles has provided insights into the shared genetic basis of many complex traits. However, large-scale inference sets a high bar for both statistical power and biological interpretability. Here we introduce a principled framework to estimate annotation-stratified genetic covariance between traits using GWAS summary statistics. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that our method provides accurate covariance estimates, thereby enabling researchers to dissect both the shared and distinct genetic architecture across traits to better understand their etiologies. Among 50 complex traits with publicly accessible GWAS summary statistics (Ntotal\u2248 4.5 million), we identified more than 170 pairs with statistically significant genetic covariance. In particular, we found strong genetic covariance between late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two major neurodegenerative diseases, in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high minor allele frequencies and in SNPs located in the predicted functional genome. Joint analysis of LOAD, ALS, and other traits highlights LOAD's correlation with cognitive traits and hints at an autoimmune component for ALS. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Lu Q, Li B, Ou D, Erlendsdottir M, ...&amp;, Zhao H.

Moreover, we propose representing the empirical LD matrix as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a banded matrix. We show that this way of modeling the LD can not only reduce the storage and memory cost, but also improve the computational efficiency of heritability estimation.

Here, we introduce methods that estimate the total trait variance explained by the typed variants at a single locus in the genome (local SNP heritability) from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data while accounting for linkage disequilibrium among variants. We applied our estimator to ultra-large-scale GWAS summary data of 30 common traits and diseases to gain insights into their local genetic architecture. First, we found that common SNPs have a high contribution to the heritability of all studied traits. Second, we identified traits for which the majority of the SNP heritability can be confined to a small percentage of the genome. Third, we identified GWAS risk loci where the entire locus explains significantly more variance in the trait than the GWAS reported variants. Finally, we identified loci that explain a significant amount of heritability across multiple traits. </li> <li>CITATION : Shi H, Kichaev G, Pasaniuc B.

Current tools for local rg analysis are restricted to analysis of two phenotypes. Here we introduce LAVA, an integrated framework for local rg analysis that, in addition to testing the standard bivariate local rgs between two phenotypes, can evaluate local heritabilities and analyze conditional genetic relations between several phenotypes using partial correlation and multiple regression. Applied to 25 behavioral and health phenotypes, we show considerable heterogeneity in the bivariate local rgs across the genome, which is often masked by the global rg patterns, and demonstrate how our conditional approaches can elucidate more complex, multivariate genetic relations. </li> <li>CITATION : Werme J, van der Sluis S, Posthuma D, de Leeuw CA.

We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes &gt;99% of SNP variants with a frequency of &gt;1% for a variety of ancestries.

However, the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is still not suitable for gigantic studies due to budget constraints. It is particularly important to construct highly accurate haplotype reference panel for genotype imputation. In this study, we used 10 000 samples with medium-depth WGS to construct a reference panel that we named the CKB reference panel. By imputing microarray datasets, it showed that the CKB panel outperformed compared panels in terms of both the number of well-imputed variants and imputation accuracy. In addition, we have completed the imputation of 100 706 microarrays with the CKB panel, and the after-imputed data is the hitherto largest whole genome data of the Chinese population. Furthermore, in the GWAS analysis of real phenotype height, the number of tested SNPs tripled and the number of significant SNPs doubled after imputation. Finally, we developed an online server for offering free genotype imputation service based on the CKB reference panel (https://db.cngb.org/imputation/). We believe that the CKB panel is of great value for imputing microarray or low-coverage genotype data of Chinese population, and potentially mixed populations. The imputation-completed 100 706 microarray data are enormous and precious resources of population genetic studies for complex traits and diseases. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Yu C, Lan X, Tao Y, Guo Y, ...&amp;, Li L.

The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) and Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), which have recently been sequenced to high coverage, are valuable genomic resources because of the global diversity they capture and their open data sharing policies. Here, we harmonized a high-quality set of 4094 whole genomes from 80 populations in the HGDP and 1kGP with data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and identified over 153 million high-quality SNVs, indels, and SVs. We performed a detailed ancestry analysis of this cohort, characterizing population structure and patterns of admixture across populations, analyzing site frequency spectra, and measuring variant counts at global and subcontinental levels. We also show substantial added value from this data set compared with the prior versions of the component resources, typically combined via liftOver and variant intersection; for example, we catalog millions of new genetic variants, mostly rare, compared with previous releases. In addition to unrestricted individual-level public release, we provide detailed tutorials for conducting many of the most common quality-control steps and analyses with these data in a scalable cloud-computing environment and publicly release this new phased joint callset for use as a haplotype resource in phasing and imputation pipelines. This jointly called reference panel will serve as a key resource to support research of diverse ancestry populations. </li> <li>CITATION : Koenig Z, Yohannes MT, Nkambule LL, Zhao X, ...&amp;, Martin AR.

Resources such as imputation reference panels that match the study population are necessary to find low-frequency variants with substantial effects. We created a reference panel consisting of 14,393 whole-genome sequences including more than 11,000 Asian individuals. Genome-wide association studies were conducted using the reference panel and a population-specific genotype array of 72,298 subjects for eight phenotypes. This panel yields improved imputation accuracy of rare and low-frequency variants within East Asian populations compared with the largest reference panel. Thirty-nine previously unidentified associations were found, and more than half of the variants were East Asian specific. We discovered genes with rare protein-altering variants, including LTBP1 for height and GPR75 for body mass index, as well as putative regulatory mechanisms for rare noncoding variants with cell type-specific effects. We suggest that this dataset will add to the potential value of Asian precision medicine. </li> <li>CITATION : Choi J, Kim S, Kim J, Son HY, ...&amp;, Im SW.

Here, we present the NyuWa genome resource, based on deep (26.2\u00d7) sequencing of 2,999 Chinese individuals, and construct a NyuWa reference panel of 5,804 haplotypes and 19.3 million variants, which is a high-quality publicly available Chinese population-specific reference panel with thousands of samples. Compared with other panels, the NyuWa reference panel reduces the Han Chinese imputation error rate by a margin ranging from 30% to 51%. Population structure and imputation simulation tests support the applicability of one integrated reference panel for northern and southern Chinese. In addition, a total of 22,504 loss-of-function variants in coding and noncoding genes are identified, including 11,493 novel variants.

However, the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is still not suitable for gigantic studies due to budget constraints. It is particularly important to construct highly accurate haplotype reference panel for genotype imputation. In this study, we used 10 000 samples with medium-depth WGS to construct a reference panel that we named the CKB reference panel. By imputing microarray datasets, it showed that the CKB panel outperformed compared panels in terms of both the number of well-imputed variants and imputation accuracy. In addition, we have completed the imputation of 100 706 microarrays with the CKB panel, and the after-imputed data is the hitherto largest whole genome data of the Chinese population. Furthermore, in the GWAS analysis of real phenotype height, the number of tested SNPs tripled and the number of significant SNPs doubled after imputation. Finally, we developed an online server for offering free genotype imputation service based on the CKB reference panel (https://db.cngb.org/imputation/). We believe that the CKB panel is of great value for imputing microarray or low-coverage genotype data of Chinese population, and potentially mixed populations. The imputation-completed 100 706 microarray data are enormous and precious resources of population genetic studies for complex traits and diseases. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Yu C, Lan X, Tao Y, Guo Y, ...&amp;, Li L.

Here, we present the NyuWa genome resource, based on deep (26.2\u00d7) sequencing of 2,999 Chinese individuals, and construct a NyuWa reference panel of 5,804 haplotypes and 19.3 million variants, which is a high-quality publicly available Chinese population-specific reference panel with thousands of samples. Compared with other panels, the NyuWa reference panel reduces the Han Chinese imputation error rate by a margin ranging from 30% to 51%. Population structure and imputation simulation tests support the applicability of one integrated reference panel for northern and southern Chinese. In addition, a total of 22,504 loss-of-function variants in coding and noncoding genes are identified, including 11,493 novel variants.

Over the past 15 years, reference panels have become larger and more diverse, leading to improvements in imputation accuracy. However, the latest generation of reference panels is subject to restrictions on data sharing due to concerns about privacy, limiting their usefulness for genotype imputation. In this context, here we propose RESHAPE, a method that employs a recombination Poisson process on a reference panel to simulate the genomes of hypothetical descendants after multiple generations. This data transformation helps to protect against re-identification threats and preserves data attributes, such as linkage disequilibrium patterns and, to some degree, identity-by-descent sharing, allowing for genotype imputation. Our experiments on gold-standard datasets show that simulated descendants up to eight generations can serve as reference panels without substantially reducing genotype imputation accuracy. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Cavinato T, Rubinacci S, Malaspinas AS, Delaneau O.

One of these challenges is haplotype inference; methods for haplotype inference designed for small data sets from candidate-gene studies do not scale well to the large number of individuals genotyped in whole-genome association studies. We present a new method and software for inference of haplotype phase and missing data that can accurately phase data from whole-genome association studies, and we present the first comparison of haplotype-inference methods for real and simulated data sets with thousands of genotyped individuals. We find that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy for large data sets with thousands of individuals and densely spaced genetic markers, and we use our method to phase a real data set of 3,002 individuals genotyped for 490,032 markers in 3.1 days of computing time, with 99% of masked alleles imputed correctly.

The imputation method, based on the Li and Stephens model and implemented in Beagle v.4.1, is parallelized and memory efficient, making it well suited to multi-core computer processors. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient genotype imputation by restricting the probability model to markers that are genotyped in the target samples and by performing linear interpolation to impute ungenotyped variants. We compare Beagle v.4.1 with Impute2 and Minimac3 by using 1000 Genomes Project data, UK10K Project data, and simulated data. All three methods have similar accuracy but different memory requirements and different computation times. When imputing 10 Mb of sequence data from 50,000 reference samples, Beagle's throughput was more than 100\u00d7 greater than Impute2's throughput on our computer servers. When imputing 10 Mb of sequence data from 200,000 reference samples in VCF format, Minimac3 consumed 26\u00d7 more memory per computational thread and 15\u00d7 more CPU time than Beagle. We demonstrate that Beagle v.4.1 scales to much larger reference panels by performing imputation from a simulated reference panel having 5 million samples and a mean marker density of one marker per four base pairs. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Browning BL, Browning SR.

In general, one should perform genotype imputation using the largest reference panel that is available because the number of accurately imputed variants increases with reference panel size. However, one impediment to using larger reference panels is the increased computational cost of imputation. We present a new genotype imputation method, Beagle 5.0, which greatly reduces the computational cost of imputation from large reference panels. We compare Beagle 5.0 with Beagle 4.1, Impute4, Minimac3, and Minimac4 using 1000 Genomes Project data, Haplotype Reference Consortium data, and simulated data for 10k, 100k, 1M, and 10M reference samples. All methods produce nearly identical accuracy, but Beagle 5.0 has the lowest computation time and the best scaling of computation time with increasing reference panel size. For 10k, 100k, 1M, and 10M reference samples and 1,000 phased target samples, Beagle 5.0's computation time is 3\u00d7 (10k), 12\u00d7 (100k), 43\u00d7 (1M), and 533\u00d7 (10M) faster than the fastest alternative method. Cost data from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud show that Beagle 5.0 can perform genome-wide imputation from 10M reference samples into 1,000 phased target samples at a cost of less than one US cent per sample. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Browning BL, Zhou Y, Browning SR.

We present a fast, accurate, and memory-efficient haplotype phasing method that scales to large-scale SNP array and sequence data. The method uses marker windowing and composite reference haplotypes to reduce memory usage and computation time. It incorporates a progressive phasing algorithm that identifies confidently phased heterozygotes in each iteration and fixes the phase of these heterozygotes in subsequent iterations. For data with many low-frequency variants, such as whole-genome sequence data, the method employs a two-stage phasing algorithm that phases high-frequency markers via progressive phasing in the first stage and phases low-frequency markers via genotype imputation in the second stage. This haplotype phasing method is implemented in the open-source Beagle 5.2 software package. We compare Beagle 5.2 and SHAPEIT 4.2.1 by using expanding subsets of 485,301 UK Biobank samples and 38,387 TOPMed samples. Both methods have very similar accuracy and computation time for UK Biobank SNP array data. However, for TOPMed sequence data, Beagle is more than 20 times faster than SHAPEIT, achieves similar accuracy, and scales to larger sample sizes. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Browning BL, Tian X, Zhou Y, Browning SR.

We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a \u223c20\u00d7 speedup and \u223c10% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves &gt;2\u00d7 the accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing.

A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped.

Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers.

Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15%-20% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions. </li> <li>CITATION : Howie BN, Donnelly P, Marchini J.

In the last 10 years reference panels have increased in size by more than 100 fold. Increasing reference panel size improves accuracy of markers with low minor allele frequencies but poses ever increasing computational challenges for imputation methods. Here we present IMPUTE5, a genotype imputation method that can scale to reference panels with millions of samples. This method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2 method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast, accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE5 identifies locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as conditioning states within the IMPUTE model. Using the HRC reference panel, which has \u223c65,000 haplotypes, we show that IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster than BEAGLE5.1, and uses less memory than both these methods. Using simulated reference panels we show that IMPUTE5 scales sub-linearly with reference panel size. For example, keeping the number of imputed markers constant, increasing the reference panel size from 10,000 to 1 million haplotypes requires less than twice the computation time. As the reference panel increases in size IMPUTE5 is able to utilize a smaller number of reference haplotypes, thus reducing computational cost. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Rubinacci S, Delaneau O, Marchini J.

Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor </li> <li>CITATION : Li Y, Willer CJ, Ding J, Scheet P, ...&amp;, Abecasis GR.

However, imputing from large reference panels with existing methods imposes a high computational burden. We introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that maintains the accuracy of leading methods while reducing computational costs. We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the 1000 Genomes Project.

Here we present QUILT, which performs diploid genotype imputation using low-coverage whole-genome sequence data. QUILT employs Gibbs sampling to partition reads into maternal and paternal sets, facilitating rapid haploid imputation using large reference panels. We show this partitioning to be accurate over many megabases, enabling highly accurate imputation close to theoretical limits and outperforming existing methods. Moreover, QUILT can impute accurately using diverse technologies, including long reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and a new form of low-cost barcoded Illumina sequencing called haplotagging, with the latter showing improved accuracy at low coverages. Relative to DNA genotyping microarrays, QUILT offers improved accuracy at reduced cost, particularly for diverse populations that are traditionally underserved in modern genomic analyses, with accuracy nearly doubling at rare SNPs. Finally, QUILT can accurately impute (four-digit) human leukocyte antigen types, the first such method from low-coverage sequence data. </li> <li>CITATION : Davies RW, Kucka M, Su D, Shi S, ...&amp;, Myers S.

This model is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population tend to cluster into groups of similar haplotypes. To capture the fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach is flexible, allowing for both \"block-like\" patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance. The resulting model is also fast and, as a result, is practicable for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch error was 0.055 for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates, in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens Lab Web site. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Scheet P, Stephens M.

Genotype imputation increases statistical power, facilitates fine mapping of causal variants, and plays a key role in meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Only variants that were previously observed in a reference panel of sequenced individuals can be imputed. However, the rapid increase in the number of deeply sequenced individuals will soon make it possible to assemble enormous reference panels that greatly increase the number of imputable variants.

In the traditional MR setting, data on the IV, exposure, and outcome are available for all participants. However, obtaining complete exposure data may be difficult in some settings, due to high measurement costs or lack of appropriate biospecimens. We used simulated data sets to assess statistical power and bias for MR when exposure data are available for a subset (or an independent set) of participants. We show that obtaining exposure data for a subset of participants is a cost-efficient strategy, often having negligible effects on power in comparison with a traditional complete-data analysis. The size of the subset needed to achieve maximum power depends on IV strength, and maximum power is approximately equal to the power of traditional IV estimators. Weak IVs are shown to lead to bias towards the null when the subsample is small and towards the confounded association when the subset is relatively large. Various approaches for confidence interval calculation are considered. These results have important implications for reducing the costs and increasing the feasibility of MR studies. </li> <li>CITATION : Pierce BL, Burgess S.

This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation. </li> <li>CITATION : Bowden J, Davey Smith G, Burgess S.

Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures. </li> <li>CITATION : Smith GD, Ebrahim S.

However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as CIT is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality. </li> <li>CITATION : Hemani G, Tilling K, Davey Smith G.

Binary and categorical phenotypes can be modelled in terms of liability-an underlying latent continuous variable with liability thresholds separating individuals into categories. Genetic variants influence an individual's categorical exposure via their effects on liability, thus Mendelian-randomization analyses with categorical exposures will capture effects of liability that act independently of exposure category. METHODS AND RESULTS: We discuss how groups in which the categorical exposure is invariant can be used to detect liability effects acting independently of exposure category. For example, associations between an adult educational-attainment polygenic score (PGS) and body mass index measured before the minimum school leaving age (e.g. age 10 years), cannot indicate the effects of years in full-time education on this outcome. Using UK Biobank data, we show that a higher educational-attainment PGS is strongly associated with lower smoking initiation and higher odds of glasses use at age 15 years. These associations were replicated in sibling models. An orthogonal approach using the raising of the school leaving age (ROSLA) policy change found that individuals who chose to remain in education to age 16 years before the reform likely had higher liability to educational attainment than those who were compelled to remain in education to age 16 years after the reform, and had higher income, lower pack-years of smoking, higher odds of glasses use and lower deprivation in adulthood. These results suggest that liability to educational attainment is associated with health and social outcomes independently of years in full-time education. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian-randomization studies with non-continuous exposures should be interpreted in terms of liability, which may affect the outcome via changes in exposure category and/or independently. </li> <li>CITATION : Howe LJ, Tudball M, Davey Smith G, Davies NM.

Mendelian randomization studies often draw on novel information generated in genome-wide association studies on causal associations between genetic variants and a risk factor or lifestyle factor. Such information can then be used in a largely unconfounded study design free of reverse causation to understand if and how risk factors and lifestyle factors cause cardiovascular disease. If causation is demonstrated, an opportunity for prevention of disease is identified; importantly however, before prevention or treatment can be implemented, randomized intervention trials altering risk factor levels or improving deleterious lifestyle factors needs to document reductions in cardiovascular disease in a safe and side-effect sparse manner. Documentation of causality can also inform on potential drug targets, more likely to be successful than prior approaches often relying on animal or cell studies mainly. The present review summarizes the history and background of Mendelian randomization, the study design, assumptions for using the design, and the most common caveats, followed by a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of different types of Mendelian randomization studies using one or more samples and different levels of information on study participants. The review also provides an overview of results on many of the risk factors and lifestyle factors for cardiovascular disease examined to date using the Mendelian randomization study design. </li> <li>CITATION : Benn M, Nordestgaard BG.

Many robust MR methods are available to address pleiotropy, but these assume independence between the gene-exposure and gene-outcome association estimates. Unlike in two-sample MR, in one-sample MR the two estimates are obtained from the same individuals, and the assumption of independence does not hold in the presence of confounding. METHODS: With simulations mimicking a typical study in UK Biobank, we assessed the performance, in terms of bias and precision of the MR estimate, of the fixed-effect and (multiplicative) random-effects meta-analysis method, weighted median estimator, weighted mode estimator and MR-Egger regression, used in both one-sample and two-sample data. We considered scenarios differing by the: presence/absence of a true causal effect; amount of confounding; and presence and type of pleiotropy (none, balanced or directional). RESULTS: Even in the presence of substantial correlation due to confounding, all two-sample methods used in one-sample MR performed similarly to when used in two-sample MR, except for MR-Egger which resulted in bias reflecting direction and magnitude of the confounding. Such bias was much reduced in the presence of very high variability in instrument strength across variants (IGX2 of 97%). CONCLUSIONS: Two-sample MR methods can be safely used for one-sample MR performed within large biobanks, expect for MR-Egger. MR-Egger is not recommended for one-sample MR unless the correlation between the gene-exposure and gene-outcome estimates due to confounding can be kept low, or the variability in instrument strength is very high. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Minelli C, Del Greco M F, van der Plaat DA, Bowden J, ...&amp;, Thompson J.

MR exploits the fact that genotypes are not generally susceptible to reverse causation and confounding, due to their fixed nature and Mendel's First and Second Laws of Inheritance. MR has the potential to provide information on causality in many situations where randomized controlled trials are not possible, but the results of MR studies must be interpreted carefully to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we outline the principles behind MR, as well as assumptions and limitations of the method. Extensions to the basic approach are discussed, including two-sample MR, bidirectional MR, two-step MR, multivariable MR, and factorial MR. We also consider some new applications and recent developments in the methodology, including its ability to inform drug development, automation of the method using tools such as MR-Base, and phenome-wide and hypothesis-free MR. SUMMARY: In conjunction with the growing availability of large-scale genomic databases, higher level of automation and increased robustness of the methods, MR promises to be a valuable strategy to examine causality in complex biological/omics networks, inform drug development and prioritize intervention targets for disease prevention in the future. </li> <li>CITATION : Zheng J, Baird D, Borges MC, Bowden J, ...&amp;, Smith GD.

This paper summarizes statistical methods commonly applied and strait forward to use for conducting MR analyses including those taking advantage of the rich dataset of SNP-trait associations that were revealed in the last decade through large-scale genome-wide association studies. Using these data, powerful MR studies are possible. However, the causal estimate may be biased in case the assumptions of MR are violated. The source and the type of this bias are described while providing a summary of the mathematical formulas that should help estimating the magnitude and direction of the potential bias depending on the specific research setting. Finally, methods for relaxing the assumptions and for conducting sensitivity analyses are discussed. Future researches in the field of MR include the assessment of non-linear causal effects, and automatic detection of invalid instruments. </li> <li>CITATION : Teumer A.

The principles of MR are based on Mendel's laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and give methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future. The difference between the assumptions required for MR analysis and other forms of non-interventional epidemiological studies means that MR can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference. </li> <li>CITATION : Sanderson E, Glymour MM, Holmes MV, Kang H, ...&amp;, Smith GD.

However, the genes or functional DNA elements through which these variants exert their effects on the traits are often unknown. We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhu Z, Zhang F, Hu H, Bakshi A, ...&amp;, Yang J.

We perform an integrative analysis that uses summary-level SNP data from multi-omics studies to detect DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with gene expression and phenotype through shared genetic effects (i.e., pleiotropy). We identify pleiotropic associations between 7858 DNAm sites and 2733 genes. These DNAm sites are enriched in enhancers and promoters, and &gt;40% of them are mapped to distal genes. Further pleiotropic association analyses, which link both the methylome and transcriptome to 12 complex traits, identify 149 DNAm sites and 66 genes, indicating a plausible mechanism whereby the effect of a genetic variant on phenotype is mediated by genetic regulation of transcription through DNAm. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Wu Y, Zeng J, Zhang F, Zhu Z, ...&amp;, Yang J.

However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Hemani G, Zheng J, Elsworth B, Wade KH, ...&amp;, Haycock PC.

One way to improving power to detect further novel loci is through meta-analysis of studies from the same population, increasing the sample size over any individual study. Although statistical software analysis packages incorporate routines for meta-analysis, they are ill equipped to meet the challenges of the scale and complexity of data generated in genome-wide association studies. RESULTS: We have developed flexible, open-source software for the meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. The software incorporates a variety of error trapping facilities, and provides a range of meta-analysis summary statistics. The software is distributed with scripts that allow simple formatting of files containing the results of each association study and generate graphical summaries of genome-wide meta-analysis results.

Meta-analyses of genomewide association studies, primarily ascertained from European-descent populations, have made considerable advances in our understanding of complex trait genetics, although much of their heritability is still unexplained. With the increasing availability of genomewide association data from diverse populations, transethnic meta-analysis may offer an exciting opportunity to increase the power to detect novel complex trait loci and to improve the resolution of fine-mapping of causal variants by leveraging differences in local linkage disequilibrium structure between ethnic groups. However, we might also expect there to be substantial genetic heterogeneity between diverse populations, both in terms of the spectrum of causal variants and their allelic effects, which cannot easily be accommodated through traditional approaches to meta-analysis. In order to address this challenge, I propose novel transethnic meta-analysis methodology that takes account of the expected similarity in allelic effects between the most closely related populations, while allowing for heterogeneity between more diverse ethnic groups. This approach yields substantial improvements in performance, compared to fixed-effects meta-analysis, both in terms of power to detect association, and localization of the causal variant, over a range of models of heterogeneity between ethnic groups. Furthermore, when the similarity in allelic effects between populations is well captured by their relatedness, this approach has increased power and mapping resolution over random-effects meta-analysis. </li> <li>CITATION : Morris AP.

This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007].  Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates.

However, heterogeneity in allelic effects between GWAS at these loci can occur that is correlated with ancestry. Here, a novel approach is presented to detect SNP association and quantify the extent of heterogeneity in allelic effects that is correlated with ancestry. We employ trans-ethnic meta-regression to model allelic effects as a function of axes of genetic variation, derived from a matrix of mean pairwise allele frequency differences between GWAS, and implemented in the MR-MEGA software. Through detailed simulations, we demonstrate increased power to detect association for MR-MEGA over fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis across a range of scenarios of heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups. We also demonstrate improved fine-mapping resolution, in loci containing a single causal variant, compared to these meta-analysis approaches and PAINTOR, and equivalent performance to MANTRA at reduced computational cost. Application of MR-MEGA to trans-ethnic GWAS of kidney function in 71,461 individuals indicates stronger signals of association than fixed-effects meta-analysis when heterogeneity in allelic effects is correlated with ancestry. Application of MR-MEGA to fine-mapping four type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci in 22,086 cases and 42,539 controls highlights: (i) strong evidence for heterogeneity in allelic effects that is correlated with ancestry only at the index SNP for the association signal at the CDKAL1 locus; and (ii) 99% credible sets with six or fewer variants for five distinct association signals. </li> <li>CITATION : M\u00e4gi R, Horikoshi M, Sofer T, Mahajan A, ...&amp;, Morris AP.

For example, combining GWASs of related but distinct traits can provide promising directions for the discovery of loci with small but common pleiotropic effects. Classical approaches for meta-analysis or pooled analysis, however, might not be suitable for such analysis because individual variants are likely to be associated with only a subset of the traits or might demonstrate effects in different directions. We propose a method that exhaustively explores subsets of studies for the presence of true association signals that are in either the same direction or possibly opposite directions. An efficient approximation is used for rapid evaluation of p values. We present two illustrative applications, one for a meta-analysis of separate case-control studies of six distinct cancers and another for pooled analysis of a case-control study of glioma, a class of brain tumors that contains heterogeneous subtypes. Both the applications and additional simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods offer improved power and more interpretable results when compared to traditional methods for the analysis of heterogeneous traits. The proposed framework has applications beyond genetic association studies. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Bhattacharjee S, Rajaraman P, Jacobs KB, Wheeler WA, ...&amp;, Chatterjee N.

While methods have been proposed to characterize pleiotropic components across groups of phenotypes, scaling these approaches to ultra-large-scale biobanks has been challenging. Here, we propose FactorGo, a scalable variational factor analysis model to identify and characterize pleiotropic components using biobank GWAS summary data. In extensive simulations, we observe that FactorGo outperforms the state-of-the-art (model-free) approach tSVD in capturing latent pleiotropic factors across phenotypes while maintaining a similar computational cost. We apply FactorGo to estimate 100 latent pleiotropic factors from GWAS summary data of 2,483 phenotypes measured in European-ancestry Pan-UK BioBank individuals (N = 420,531). Next, we find that factors from FactorGo are more enriched with relevant tissue-specific annotations than those identified by tSVD (p = 2.58E-10) and validate our approach by recapitulating brain-specific enrichment for BMI and the height-related connection between reproductive system and muscular-skeletal growth. Finally, our analyses suggest shared etiologies between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal condition in addition to alkaline phosphatase as a candidate prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Overall, FactorGo improves our biological understanding of shared etiologies across thousands of GWASs. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhang Z, Jung J, Kim A, Suboc N, ...&amp;, Mancuso N.

In this study we directly compared a number of multivariate GWAS methods using simulated data. We focused on six methods that are implemented in the software packages PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen, BIMBAM, PCHAT and TATES, and also compared them to standard univariate GWAS, analysis of the first principal component of the traits, and meta-analysis of univariate results. We simulated data (N = 1000) for three quantitative traits and one bi-allelic quantitative trait locus (QTL), and varied the number of traits associated with the QTL (explained variance 0.1%), minor allele frequency of the QTL, residual correlation between the traits, and the sign of the correlation induced by the QTL relative to the residual correlation. We compared the power of the methods using empirically fixed significance thresholds (\u03b1 = 0.05). Our results showed that the multivariate methods implemented in PLINK, SNPTEST, MultiPhen and BIMBAM performed best for the majority of the tested scenarios, with a notable increase in power for scenarios with an opposite sign of genetic and residual correlation. All multivariate analyses resulted in a higher power than univariate analyses, even when only one of the traits was associated with the QTL. Hence, use of multivariate GWAS methods can be recommended, even when genetic correlations between traits are weak. </li> <li>CITATION : Galesloot TE, van Steen K, Kiemeney LA, Janss LL, ...&amp;, Vermeulen SH.

Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and single-nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to model multivariate genetic associations among phenotypes, identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, calculate more predictive polygenic scores and identify loci that cause divergence between traits. We demonstrate several applications of genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of summary statistics from five psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms not previously identified in the contributing univariate GWASs. Polygenic scores from genomic SEM consistently outperform those from univariate GWASs.

We propose heritability informed power optimization (HIPO) for conducting powerful pleiotropic analysis using summary-level association statistics. We find optimal linear combinations of association coefficients across traits that are expected to maximize non-centrality parameter for the underlying test statistics, taking into account estimates of heritability, sample size variations and overlaps across the traits. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has correct type I error, robust to population stratification and leads to desired genome-wide enrichment of association signals. Application of the proposed method to publicly available data for three groups of genetically related traits, lipids (N = 188,577), psychiatric diseases (Ncase = 33,332, Ncontrol = 27,888) and social science traits (N ranging between 161,460 to 298,420 across individual traits) increased the number of genome-wide significant loci by 12%, 200% and 50%, respectively, compared to those found by analysis of individual traits. Evidence of replication is present for many of these loci in subsequent larger studies for individual traits. HIPO can potentially be extended to high-dimensional phenotypes as a way of dimension reduction to maximize power for subsequent genetic association testing. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Qi G, Chatterjee N.

Thousands of GWAS summary statistics covering a broad range of human traits and diseases are now publicly available. These GWAS have proven their utility for a range of secondary analyses, including in particular the joint analysis of multiple phenotypes to identify new associated genetic variants. However, although several methods have been proposed, there are very few large-scale applications published so far because of challenges in implementing these methods on real data. Here, we present JASS (Joint Analysis of Summary Statistics), a polyvalent Python package that addresses this need. Our package incorporates recently developed joint tests such as the omnibus approach and various weighted sum of Z-score tests while solving all practical and computational barriers for large-scale multivariate analysis of GWAS summary statistics. This includes data cleaning and harmonization tools, an efficient algorithm for fast derivation of joint statistics, an optimized data management process and a web interface for exploration purposes. Both benchmark analyses and real data applications demonstrated the robustness and strong potential of JASS for the detection of new associated genetic variants.

They have, however, lacked essential analytic tools to follow-up and understand the biology underlying these associations. We developed a novel computational workflow for multivariate GWAS follow-up analyses, including fine-mapping and identification of the subset of traits driving associations (driver traits). Many follow-up tools require univariate regression coefficients which are lacking from multivariate results. Our method overcomes this problem by using Canonical Correlation Analysis to turn each multivariate association into its optimal univariate Linear Combination Phenotype (LCP). This enables an LCP-GWAS, which in turn generates the statistics required for follow-up analyses. We implemented our method on 12 highly correlated inflammatory biomarkers in a Finnish population-based study. Altogether, we identified 11 associations, four of which (F5, ABO, C1orf140 and PDGFRB) were not detected by biomarker-specific analyses. Fine-mapping identified 19 signals within the 11 loci and driver trait analysis determined the traits contributing to the associations. A phenome-wide association study on the 19 representative variants from the signals in 176,899 individuals from the FinnGen study revealed 53 disease associations (p &lt; 1 \u00d7 10-4). Several reported pQTLs in the 11 loci provided orthogonal evidence for the biologically relevant functions of the representative variants. Our novel multivariate analysis workflow provides a powerful addition to standard univariate GWAS analyses by enabling multivariate GWAS follow-up and thus promoting the advancement of powerful multivariate methods in genomics. </li> <li>CITATION : Ruotsalainen SE, Partanen JJ, Cichonska A, Lin J, ...&amp;, Koskela J.

At the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of \u03b1 = 5 \u00d7 10-8, MOSTest identifies 347 genomic loci associated with regional brain morphology, more than any previous study, improving upon the discovery of established GWAS approaches more than threefold.

However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes. </li> <li>CITATION : O'Reilly PF, Hoggart CJ, Pomyen Y, Calboli FC, ...&amp;, Coin LJ.

A common statistical approach to this problem involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually (PHN); and taking a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of independent tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a dimension reduction technique, such as estimation of principal components, and test for an association with the principal components of the phenotypes (PCP) rather than the individual phenotypes. Building on the work of Lange and colleagues we develop an alternative method based on the principal component of heritability (PCH). For each SNP the PCH approach reduces the phenotypes to a single trait that has a higher heritability than any other linear combination of the phenotypes. As a result, the association between a SNP and derived trait is often easier to detect than an association with any of the individual phenotypes or the PCP. When applied to unrelated subjects, PCH has a drawback. For each SNP it is necessary to estimate the vector of loadings that maximize the heritability over all phenotypes. We develop a method of iterated sample splitting that uses one portion of the data for training and the remainder for testing. This cross-validation approach maintains the type I error control and yet utilizes the data efficiently, resulting in a powerful test for association. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor </li> <li>CITATION : Klei L, Luca D, Devlin B, Roeder K.

Numerous multi-trait GWAS methods that exploit either summary statistics or individual-level data have been developed, but their relative performance is unclear. Here we develop a simulation framework to model the complex networks underlying multivariate genetic epidemiology, enabling the vast model space of genetic effects on multiple correlated traits to be explored systematically. We perform a comprehensive comparison of the leading multi-trait GWAS methods, finding: (1) method performance is highly sensitive to the specific combination of genetic effects and phenotypic correlations, (2) most of the current multivariate methods have remarkably similar statistical power, and (3) multivariate methods may offer a substantial increase in the discovery of genetic variants over the standard univariate approach. We believe our findings offer the clearest picture to date of the relative performance of multi-trait GWAS methods and act as a guide for method selection.

Genetic epidemiologic studies have identified loci associated with multiple phenotypes, and these cross-phenotype associations are often incorrectly interpreted as examples of pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is only one possible explanation for cross-phenotype associations. Cross-phenotype associations may also arise due to issues related to study design, confounder bias, or nongenetic causal links between the phenotypes under analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to dissect cross-phenotype associations carefully to uncover true pleiotropic loci. In this review, we describe statistical methods that can be used to identify robust statistical evidence of pleiotropy. First, we provide an overview of univariate and multivariate methods for discovery of cross-phenotype associations and highlight important considerations for choosing among available methods. Then, we describe how to dissect cross-phenotype associations by using mediation analysis. Pleiotropic loci provide insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of disease comorbidity, and they may serve as novel targets for interventions that simultaneously treat multiple diseases. Discerning between different types of cross-phenotype associations is necessary to realize the public health potential of pleiotropic loci. </li> <li>CITATION : Salinas YD, Wang Z, DeWan AT.

This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations - that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5-10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data. </li> <li>CITATION : Stephens M.

As GWAS analyses are generally univariate in nature, multivariate phenotypic information is usually reduced to a single composite score. This practice often results in loss of statistical power to detect causal variants. Multivariate genotype-phenotype methods do exist but attain maximal power only in special circumstances. Here, we present a new multivariate method that we refer to as TATES (Trait-based Association Test that uses Extended Simes procedure), inspired by the GATES procedure proposed by Li et al (2011). For each component of a multivariate trait, TATES combines p-values obtained in standard univariate GWAS to acquire one trait-based p-value, while correcting for correlations between components. Extensive simulations, probing a wide variety of genotype-phenotype models, show that TATES's false positive rate is correct, and that TATES's statistical power to detect causal variants explaining 0.5% of the variance can be 2.5-9 times higher than the power of univariate tests based on composite scores and 1.5-2 times higher than the power of the standard MANOVA. Unlike other multivariate methods, TATES detects both genetic variants that are common to multiple phenotypes and genetic variants that are specific to a single phenotype, i.e. TATES provides a more complete view of the genetic architecture of complex traits. As the actual causal genotype-phenotype model is usually unknown and probably phenotypically and genetically complex, TATES, available as an open source program, constitutes a powerful new multivariate strategy that allows researchers to identify novel causal variants, while the complexity of traits is no longer a limiting factor. </li> <li>CITATION : van der Sluis S, Posthuma D, Dolan CV.

Multivariate phenotypes are frequently encountered in genetic association studies. The purpose of analyzing multivariate phenotypes usually includes discovery of novel genetic variants of pleiotropy effects, that is, affecting multiple phenotypes, and the ultimate goal of uncovering the underlying genetic mechanism. In recent years, there have been new method development and application of existing statistical methods to such phenotypes. In this paper, we provide a review of the available methods for analyzing association between a single marker and a multivariate phenotype consisting of the same type of components (e.g., all continuous or all categorical) or different types of components (e.g., some are continuous and others are categorical). We also reviewed causal inference methods designed to test whether the detected association with the multivariate phenotype is truly pleiotropy or the genetic marker exerts its effects on some phenotypes through affecting the others. </li> <li>CITATION : Yang Q, Wang Y.

This motivates multi-trait association analyses, which have successfully identified novel associated loci for many complex diseases. While appealing, most existing methods focus on analyzing a relatively small number of traits, and may yield inflated Type 1 error rates when a large number of traits need to be analyzed jointly. As deep phenotyping data are becoming rapidly available, we develop a novel method, referred to as aMAT (adaptive multi-trait association test), for multi-trait analysis of any number of traits. We applied aMAT to GWAS summary statistics for a set of 58 volumetric imaging derived phenotypes from the UK Biobank. aMAT had a genomic inflation factor of 1.04, indicating the Type 1 error rate was well controlled. More important, aMAT identified 24 distinct risk loci, 13 of which were ignored by standard GWAS. In comparison, the competing methods either had a suspicious genomic inflation factor or identified much fewer risk loci. Finally, four additional sets of traits have been analyzed and provided similar conclusions. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model </li> <li>CITATION : Wu C.

We identify 2293 independent loci and find that the lead variants in nearly all these loci (~99%) to be associated with \u2265 2 traits (median = 6). We observe that degree of pleiotropy estimated from our study predicts that observed in the UK Biobank for a much larger number of traits (K = 4114) (correlation = 0.43, p-value &lt; 2.2 \u00d7 10 - 16 ). Follow-up analyzes of 21 trait-specific variants indicate their link to the expression in trait-related tissues for a small number of genes involved in relevant biological processes. Our findings provide deeper insight into the nature of pleiotropy and leads to identification of highly trait-specific susceptibility variants. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Qi G, Chhetri SB, Ray D, Dutta D, ...&amp;, Chatterjee N.

However, analyzing related traits together increases statistical power, and certain complex associations become detectable only when several variants are tested jointly. Currently, modest sample sizes of individual cohorts, and restricted availability of individual-level genotype-phenotype data across the cohorts limit conducting multivariate tests. RESULTS: We introduce metaCCA, a computational framework for summary statistics-based analysis of a single or multiple studies that allows multivariate representation of both genotype and phenotype. It extends the statistical technique of canonical correlation analysis to the setting where original individual-level records are not available, and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness.Multivariate meta-analysis of two Finnish studies of nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics by metaCCA, using standard univariate output from the program SNPTEST, shows an excellent agreement with the pooled individual-level analysis of original data. Motivated by strong multivariate signals in the lipid genes tested, we envision that multivariate association testing using metaCCA has a great potential to provide novel insights from already published summary statistics from high-throughput phenotyping technologies.

For example, GWAS on risk factors for coronary artery disease analyze genetic associations of plasma lipids such as total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs) separately. However, traits are often correlated and a joint analysis may yield increased statistical power for association over multiple univariate analyses. Recently several multivariate methods have been proposed that require individual-level data. Here, we develop metaUSAT (where USAT is unified score-based association test), a novel unified association test of a single genetic variant with multiple traits that uses only summary statistics from existing GWAS. Although the existing methods either perform well when most correlated traits are affected by the genetic variant in the same direction or are powerful when only a few of the correlated traits are associated, metaUSAT is designed to be robust to the association structure of correlated traits. metaUSAT does not require individual-level data and can test genetic associations of categorical and/or continuous traits. One can also use metaUSAT to analyze a single trait over multiple studies, appropriately accounting for overlapping samples, if any. metaUSAT provides an approximate asymptotic P-value for association and is computationally efficient for implementation at a genome-wide level. Simulation experiments show that metaUSAT maintains proper type-I error at low error levels. It has similar and sometimes greater power to detect association across a wide array of scenarios compared to existing methods, which are usually powerful for some specific association scenarios only. When applied to plasma lipids summary data from the METSIM and the T2D-GENES studies, metaUSAT detected genome-wide significant loci beyond the ones identified by univariate analyses. Evidence from larger studies suggest that the variants additionally detected by our test are, indeed, associated with lipid levels in humans. In summary, metaUSAT can provide novel insights into the genetic architecture of a common disease or traits. </li> <li>CITATION : Ray D, Boehnke M.

Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD. </li> <li>CITATION : Jansen IE, Savage JE, Watanabe K, Bryois J, ...&amp;, Posthuma D.

In genome-wide association studies, single-marker meta-analysis has been widely used to increase statistical power by combining results via regression coefficients and standard errors from different studies. In analysis of rare variants in sequencing studies, region-based multimarker tests are often used to increase power. We propose meta-analysis methods for commonly used gene- or region-based rare variants tests, such as burden tests and variance component tests. Because estimation of regression coefficients of individual rare variants is often unstable or not feasible, the proposed method avoids this difficulty by calculating score statistics instead that only require fitting the null model for each study and then aggregating these score statistics across studies. Our proposed meta-analysis rare variant association tests are conducted based on study-specific summary statistics, specifically score statistics for each variant and between-variant covariance-type (linkage disequilibrium) relationship statistics for each gene or region. The proposed methods are able to incorporate different levels of heterogeneity of genetic effects across studies and are applicable to meta-analysis of multiple ancestry groups. We show that the proposed methods are essentially as powerful as joint analysis by directly pooling individual level genotype data. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our methods by varying levels of heterogeneity across studies, and we apply the proposed methods to meta-analysis of rare variant effects in a multicohort study of the genetics of blood lipid levels. </li> <li>CITATION : Lee S, Teslovich TM, Boehnke M, Lin X.

Methods in which variants are grouped for analysis are also known as variant-set, gene-based, and aggregate unit tests. The burden test and sequence kernel association test (SKAT) are two widely used variant-set tests, which were originally developed for samples of unrelated individuals and later have been extended to family data with known pedigree structures. However, computationally efficient and powerful variant-set tests are needed to make analyses tractable in large-scale WGS studies with complex study samples. In this paper, we propose the variant-set mixed model association tests (SMMAT) for continuous and binary traits using the generalized linear mixed model framework. These tests can be applied to large-scale WGS studies involving samples with population structure and relatedness, such as in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. SMMATs share the same null model for different variant sets, and a virtue of this null model, which includes covariates only, is that it needs to be fit only once for all tests in each genome-wide analysis. Simulation studies show that all the proposed SMMATs correctly control type I error rates for both continuous and binary traits in the presence of population structure and relatedness. We also illustrate our tests in a real data example of analysis of plasma fibrinogen levels in the TOPMed program (n = 23,763), using the Analysis Commons, a cloud-based computing platform. </li> <li>CITATION : Chen H, Huffman JE, Brody JA, Wang C, ...&amp;, Lin X.

Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9% and 25%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and \"ancient\" Asian breeds.

The polygenic risk score (PRS), which aggregates multiple risk alleles of candidate diseases, has emerged as a standard approach for identifying high-risk individuals. Although several studies have been performed to benchmark the PRS calculation tools and assess their potential to guide future clinical applications, some issues remain to be further investigated, such as lacking (i) various simulated data with different genetic effects; (ii) evaluation of machine learning models and (iii) evaluation on multiple ancestries studies. In this study, we systematically validated and compared 13 statistical methods, 5 machine learning models and 2 ensemble models using simulated data with additive and genetic interaction models, 22 common diseases with internal training sets, 4 common diseases with external summary statistics and 3 common diseases for trans-ancestry studies in UK Biobank. The statistical methods were better in simulated data from additive models and machine learning models have edges for data that include genetic interactions. Ensemble models are generally the best choice by integrating various statistical methods. LDpred2 outperformed the other standalone tools, whereas PRS-CS, lassosum and DBSLMM showed comparable performance. We also identified that disease heritability strongly affected the predictive performance of all methods. Both the number and effect sizes of risk SNPs are important; and sample size strongly influences the performance of all methods. For the trans-ancestry studies, we found that the performance of most methods became worse when training and testing sets were from different populations. </li> <li>CITATION : Wang C, Zhang J, Veldsman WP, Zhou X, ...&amp;, Zhang L.

Standard best practices recommend that PRSs be analyzed in cohorts that are independent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) used to derive the scores without sample overlap or relatedness between the two cohorts. However, identifying sample overlap and relatedness can be challenging in an era of GWASs performed by large biobanks and international research consortia. Although most genomics researchers are aware of best practices and theoretical concerns about sample overlap and relatedness between GWAS and PRS cohorts, the prevailing assumption is that the risk of bias is small for very large GWASs. Here, we present two real-world examples demonstrating that sample overlap and relatedness is not a minor or theoretical concern but an important potential source of bias in PRS studies. Using a recently developed statistical adjustment tool, we found that excluding overlapping and related samples was equal to or more powerful than adjusting for overlap bias. Our goal is to make genomics researchers aware of the magnitude of risk of bias from sample overlap and relatedness and to highlight the need for mitigation tools, including independent validation cohorts in PRS studies, continued development of statistical adjustment methods, and tools for researchers to test their cohorts for overlap and relatedness with GWAS cohorts without sharing individual-level data. </li> <li>CITATION : Ellis CA, Oliver KL, Harris RV, Ottman R, ...&amp;, Bahlo M.

In the present study, we show that Bayesian PRS methods can estimate the variance of an individual's PRS and can yield well-calibrated credible intervals via posterior sampling. For 13 real traits in the UK Biobank (n = 291,273 unrelated 'white British'), we observe large variances in individual PRS estimates which impact interpretation of PRS-based stratification; averaging across traits, only 0.8% (s.d. = 1.6%) of individuals with PRS point estimates in the top decile have corresponding 95% credible intervals fully contained in the top decile. We provide an analytical estimator for the expectation of individual PRS variance as a function of SNP heritability, number of causal SNPs and sample size. Our results showcase the importance of incorporating uncertainty in individual PRS estimates into subsequent analyses. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Ding Y, Hou K, Burch KS, Lapinska S, ...&amp;, Pasaniuc B.

BridgePRS is compared with the leading alternative, PRS-CSx, and two other PRS methods. Simulations suggest that the performance of BridgePRS relative to PRS-CSx increases as uncertainty increases: with lower trait heritability, higher polygenicity and greater between-population genetic diversity; and when causal variants are not present in the data. In real data, BridgePRS has a 61% larger average R2 than PRS-CSx in out-of-cohort prediction of African ancestry samples in BioMe (P = 6 \u00d7 10-5).

However, most existing PRS are primarily trained on European ancestry populations, limiting their transferability to non-European populations. In this article, we propose a novel method for generating multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk scOres based on enSemble of PEnalized Regression models (PROSPER). PROSPER integrates genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from diverse populations to develop ancestry-specific PRS with improved predictive power for minority populations. The method uses a combination of L 1 (lasso) and L 2 (ridge) penalty functions, a parsimonious specification of the penalty parameters across populations, and an ensemble step to combine PRS generated across different penalty parameters. We evaluate the performance of PROSPER and other existing methods on large-scale simulated and real datasets, including those from 23andMe Inc., the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, and All of Us. Results show that PROSPER can substantially improve multi-ancestry polygenic prediction compared to alternative methods across a wide variety of genetic architectures. In real data analyses, for example, PROSPER increased out-of-sample prediction R2 for continuous traits by an average of 70% compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian method (PRS-CSx) in the African ancestry population. Further, PROSPER is computationally highly scalable for the analysis of large SNP contents and many diverse populations. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Zhang J, Zhan J, Jin J, Ma C, ...&amp;, Chatterjee N.

As existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted predominantly in individuals of European descent, the limited transferability of PRS reduces their clinical value in non-European populations, and may exacerbate healthcare disparities. Recent efforts to level ancestry imbalance in genomic research have expanded the scale of non-European GWAS, although most remain underpowered. Here, we present a new PRS construction method, PRS-CSx, which improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. PRS-CSx couples genetic effects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage (CS) prior, enabling more accurate effect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational efficiency and robustness from PRS-CS. We show that PRS-CSx outperforms alternative methods across traits with a wide range of genetic architectures, cross-population genetic overlaps and discovery GWAS sample sizes in simulations, and improves the prediction of quantitative traits and schizophrenia risk in non-European populations. </li> <li>CITATION : Ruan Y, Lin YF, Feng YC, Chen CY, ...&amp;, Ge T.

Here, we explore methods for combining both types of information (PRS-FH) in UK Biobank data. PRSs were trained using all British individuals (n = 409,000), and target samples consisted of unrelated non-British Europeans (n = 42,000), South Asians (n = 7,000), or Africans (n = 7,000). We evaluated PRS, FH, and PRS-FH using liability-scale R 2, primarily focusing on 3 well-powered diseases (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and depression). PRS attained average prediction R 2s of 5.8%, 4.0%, and 0.53% in non-British Europeans, South Asians, and Africans, confirming poor cross-population transferability. In contrast, PRS-FH attained average prediction R 2s of 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, representing a large improvement in Europeans and an extremely large improvement in Africans. In conclusion, including family history improves the accuracy of polygenic risk scores, particularly in diverse populations. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Hujoel MLA, Loh PR, Neale BM, Price AL.

However, the broader application of PRS to the general population is hindered by the limited transferability of PRS developed in Europeans to non-European populations. To improve PRS prediction accuracy in non-European populations, we develop a statistical method called SDPRX that can effectively integrate genome wide association study summary statistics from different populations. SDPRX automatically adjusts for linkage disequilibrium differences between populations and characterizes the joint distribution of the effect sizes of a variant in two populations to be both null, population specific, or shared with correlation. Through simulations and applications to real traits, we show that SDPRX improves the prediction performance over existing methods in non-European populations. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Zhou G, Chen T, Zhao H.

Here we propose a PRS method using transfer learning techniques. Our approach, TL-PRS, uses gradient descent to fine-tune the baseline PRS model from an ancestry group with large sample GWASs to the dataset of target ancestry. In our application of constructing PRS for seven quantitative and two dichotomous traits for 10,285 individuals of South Asian ancestry and 8,168 individuals of African ancestry in UK Biobank, TL-PRS using PRS-CS as a baseline method obtained 25% average relative improvement for South Asian samples and 29% for African samples compared to the standard PRS-CS method in terms of predicted R2. Our approach increases the transferability of PRSs across ancestries and thereby helps reduce existing inequities in genetics research. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Zhao Z, Fritsche LG, Smith JA, Mukherjee B, ...&amp;, Lee S.

Here we introduce a statistical tool, MiXeR, which quantifies polygenic overlap irrespective of genetic correlation, using GWAS summary statistics. MiXeR results are presented as a Venn diagram of unique and shared polygenic components across traits. At 90% of SNP-heritability explained for each phenotype, MiXeR estimates that 8.3 K variants causally influence schizophrenia and 6.4 K influence bipolar disorder. Among these variants, 6.2 K are shared between the disorders, which have a high genetic correlation. Further, MiXeR uncovers polygenic overlap between schizophrenia and educational attainment. Despite a genetic correlation close to zero, the phenotypes share 8.3 K causal variants, while 2.5 K additional variants influence only educational attainment. By considering the polygenicity, discoverability and heritability of complex phenotypes, MiXeR analysis may improve our understanding of cross-trait genetic architectures. </li> <li>CITATION : Frei O, Holland D, Smeland OB, Shadrin AA, ...&amp;, Dale AM.

Increasing the sample size for a specific phenotype is expensive and takes time, but this sample size can be effectively increased by using genetically correlated phenotypes. We propose a framework to generate multi-PGS from thousands of publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with no need to individually select the most relevant ones. In this study, the multi-PGS framework increases prediction accuracy over single PGS for all included psychiatric disorders and other available outcomes, with prediction R2 increases of up to 9-fold for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to a single PGS. We also generate multi-PGS for phenotypes without an existing GWAS and for case-case predictions. We benchmark the multi-PGS framework against other methods and highlight its potential application to new emerging biobanks. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Albi\u00f1ana C, Zhu Z, Schork AJ, Ingason A, ...&amp;, Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ.

As a proxy of genetic liability, PRSs are utilised across multiple fields and applications. While numerous statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to optimise their predictive accuracy, these typically distil genetic liability to a single number based on aggregation of an individual's genome-wide risk alleles. This results in a key loss of information about an individual's genetic profile, which could be critical given the functional sub-structure of the genome and the heterogeneity of complex disease. In this manuscript, we introduce a 'pathway polygenic' paradigm of disease risk, in which multiple genetic liabilities underlie complex diseases, rather than a single genome-wide liability. We describe a method and accompanying software, PRSet, for computing and analysing pathway-based PRSs, in which polygenic scores are calculated across genomic pathways for each individual. We evaluate the potential of pathway PRSs in two distinct ways, creating two major sections: (1) In the first section, we benchmark PRSet as a pathway enrichment tool, evaluating its capacity to capture GWAS signal in pathways. We find that for target sample sizes of &gt;10,000 individuals, pathway PRSs have similar power for evaluating pathway enrichment as leading methods MAGMA and LD score regression, with the distinct advantage of providing individual-level estimates of genetic liability for each pathway -opening up a range of pathway-based PRS applications, (2) In the second section, we evaluate the performance of pathway PRSs for disease stratification. We show that using a supervised disease stratification approach, pathway PRSs (computed by PRSet) outperform two standard genome-wide PRSs (computed by C+T and lassosum) for classifying disease subtypes in 20 of 21 scenarios tested. As the definition and functional annotation of pathways becomes increasingly refined, we expect pathway PRSs to offer key insights into the heterogeneity of complex disease and treatment response, to generate biologically tractable therapeutic targets from polygenic signal, and, ultimately, to provide a powerful path to precision medicine. </li> <li>CITATION : Choi SW, Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez J, Ruan Y, Wu HM, ...&amp;, O'Reilly PF.

However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. FINDINGS: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use. </li> <li>CITATION : Chang CC, Chow CC, Tellier LC, Vattikuti S, ...&amp;, Lee JJ.

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required. RESULTS: Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power. CONCLUSION: PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses.

Our framework condenses these summary statistics into PRSs using various approaches such as linkage disequilibrium pruning/p value thresholding (fixed or data-adaptively optimized thresholds) and penalized, genome-wide effect size weighting. We evaluated the PRSs in two biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the population-based UK Biobank (UKB). For each PRS construct, we provide measures on predictive performance and discrimination. Besides PRS evaluation, the Cancer-PRSweb platform features construct downloads and phenome-wide PRS association study results (PRS-PheWAS) for predictive PRSs. We expect this integrated platform to accelerate PRS-related cancer research. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Fritsche LG, Patil S, Beesley LJ, VandeHaar P, ...&amp;, Mukherjee B.

Some exposures, e.g., smoking or lipid levels, have common genetic modifiers identified in genome-wide association studies. Because measurements are often unfeasible, exposure polygenic risk scores (ExPRSs) offer an alternative to study the influence of exposures on various phenotypes. Here, we collected publicly available summary statistics for 28 exposures and applied four common PRS methods to generate ExPRSs in two large biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative and the UK Biobank. We established ExPRSs for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions. Especially the addition of multiple ExPRSs showed, for several chronic conditions, an improvement compared to prediction models that only included traditional, disease-focused PRSs. To facilitate follow-up studies, we share all ExPRS constructs and generated results via an online repository called ExPRSweb. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Ma Y, Patil S, Zhou X, Mukherjee B, ...&amp;, Fritsche LG.

To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks.

Methods: We sought to construct an atlas of associations between 125 different PGS derived using results from genome-wide association studies and 249 circulating metabolites in up to 83,004 participants from the UK Biobank. Results: As an exemplar to demonstrate the value of this atlas, we conducted a hypothesis-free evaluation of all associations with glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), an inflammatory biomarker. Using bidirectional Mendelian randomization, we find that the associations highlighted likely reflect the effect of risk factors, such as adiposity or liability towards smoking, on systemic inflammation as opposed to the converse direction. Moreover, we repeated all analyses in our atlas within age strata to investigate potential sources of collider bias, such as medication usage. This was exemplified by comparing associations between lipoprotein lipid profiles and the coronary artery disease PGS in the youngest and oldest age strata, which had differing proportions of individuals undergoing statin therapy. Lastly, we generated all PGS-metabolite associations stratified by sex and separately after excluding 13 established lipid-associated loci to further evaluate the robustness of findings. Conclusions: We envisage that the atlas of results constructed in our study will motivate future hypothesis generation and help prioritize and deprioritize circulating metabolic traits for in-depth investigations.

Here we use a Bayesian mixture model that simultaneously allows variant discovery, estimation of genetic variance explained by all variants and prediction of unobserved phenotypes in new samples. We apply the method to simulated data of quantitative traits and Welcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data on disease and show that it provides accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, produces unbiased estimators of risk in new samples, and that it can estimate genetic architecture by partitioning variation across hundreds to thousands of SNPs. We estimated that, depending on the trait, 2,633 to 9,411 SNPs explain all of the SNP-based heritability in the WTCCC diseases. The majority of those SNPs (&gt;96%) had small effects, confirming a substantial polygenic component to common diseases. The proportion of the SNP-based variance explained by large effects (each SNP explaining 1% of the variance) varied markedly between diseases, ranging from almost zero for bipolar disorder to 72% for type 1 diabetes. Prediction analyses demonstrate that for diseases with major loci, such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Bayesian methods outperform profile scoring or mixed model approaches. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Moser G, Lee SH, Hayes BJ, Goddard ME, ...&amp;, Visscher PM.

We detect significant (P &lt; 0.05/28) signatures of natural selection in the genetic architecture of 23 traits, including reproductive, cardiovascular, and anthropometric traits, as well as educational attainment. The significant estimates of the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency in complex traits are consistent with a model of negative (or purifying) selection, as confirmed by forward simulation.

We analyze 50 complex traits and diseases using \u223c7 million common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 96 annotations. SBayesRC improves prediction accuracy by 14% in European ancestry and up to 34% in cross-ancestry prediction compared to the baseline method SBayesR, which does not use annotations, and outperforms other methods, including LDpred2, LDpred-funct, MegaPRS, PolyPred-S and PRS-CSx. Investigation of factors affecting prediction accuracy identifies a significant interaction between SNP density and annotation information, suggesting whole-genome sequence variants with annotations may further improve prediction.

We analyse data for 155 complex traits (n = 27k-547k) and project the estimates onto those obtained from evolutionary simulations. We estimate that, on average across traits, about 1% of human genome sequence are mutational targets with a mean selection coefficient of ~0.001. Common diseases, on average, show a smaller number of mutational targets and have been under stronger selection, compared to other traits.

PRS can predict a broad spectrum of diseases and have therefore been widely used in research settings. Some work has investigated their potential applications as biomarkers in preventative medicine, but significant work is still needed to definitively establish and communicate absolute risk to patients for genetic and modifiable risk factors across demographic groups. However, the biggest limitation of PRS currently is that they show poor generalizability across diverse ancestries and cohorts. Major efforts are underway through methodological development and data generation initiatives to improve their generalizability.

To address these issues, we propose Aggregated L0Learn using Summary-level data (ALL-Sum), a fast and scalable ensemble learning method for computing PRS using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). ALL-Sum leverages a L0L2 penalized regression and ensemble learning across tuning parameters to flexibly model traits with diverse genetic architectures. In extensive large-scale simulations across a wide range of polygenicity and GWAS sample sizes, ALL-Sum consistently outperformed popular alternative methods in terms of prediction accuracy, runtime, and memory usage by 10%, 20-fold, and threefold, respectively, and demonstrated robustness to diverse genetic architectures. We validated the performance of ALL-Sum in real data analysis of 11 complex traits using GWAS summary statistics from nine data sources, including the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, Breast Cancer Association Consortium, and FinnGen Biobank, with validation in the UK Biobank. Our results show that on average, ALL-Sum obtained PRS with 25% higher accuracy on average, with 15 times faster computation and half the memory than the current state-of-the-art methods, and had robust performance across a wide range of traits and diseases. Furthermore, our method demonstrates stable prediction when using linkage disequilibrium computed from different data sources. ALL-Sum is available as a user-friendly R software package with publicly available reference data for streamlined analysis. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Chen T, Zhang H, Mazumder R, Lin X.

We show that PGS performance varies broadly across contexts and biobanks. Contexts such as age, sex and income can impact PGS accuracy with similar magnitudes as genetic ancestry. Here we introduce an approach (CalPred) that models all contexts jointly to produce prediction intervals that vary across contexts to achieve calibration (include the trait with 90% probability), whereas existing methods are miscalibrated. In analyses of 72 traits across large and diverse biobanks (All of Us and UK Biobank), we find that prediction intervals required adjustment by up to 80% for quantitative traits. For disease traits, PGS-based predictions were miscalibrated across socioeconomic contexts such as annual household income levels, further highlighting the need of accounting for context information in PGS-based prediction across diverse populations. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Hou K, Xu Z, Ding Y, Mandla R, ...&amp;, Pasaniuc B.

Accurate PGS construction requires prediction models that are both adaptive to different genetic architectures and scalable to biobank scale datasets with millions of individuals and tens of millions of genetic variants. Here, we develop such a method called Deterministic Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model (DBSLMM). DBSLMM relies on a flexible modeling assumption on the effect size distribution to achieve robust and accurate prediction performance across a range of genetic architectures. DBSLMM also relies on a simple deterministic search algorithm to yield an approximate analytic estimation solution using summary statistics only. The deterministic search algorithm, when paired with further algebraic innovations, results in substantial computational savings. With simulations, we show that DBSLMM achieves scalable and accurate prediction performance across a range of realistic genetic architectures. We then apply DBSLMM to analyze 25 traits in UK Biobank. For these traits, compared to existing approaches, DBSLMM achieves an average of 2.03%-101.09% accuracy gain in internal cross-validations. In external validations on two separate datasets, including one from BioBank Japan, DBSLMM achieves an average of 14.74%-522.74% accuracy gain. In these real data applications, DBSLMM is 1.03-28.11 times faster and uses only 7.4%-24.8% of physical memory as compared to other multiple regression-based PGS methods. Overall, DBSLMM represents an accurate and scalable method for constructing PGS in biobank scale datasets. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Yang S, Zhou X.

Here, we apply our recently developed Bayesian grouped mixture of regressions model (GMRM) in the UK and Estonian Biobanks and obtain the highest genomic prediction accuracy reported to date across 21 heritable traits. When compared to other approaches, GMRM accuracy was greater than annotation prediction models run in the LDAK or LDPred-funct software by 15% (SE 7%) and 14% (SE 2%), respectively, and was 18% (SE 3%) greater than a baseline BayesR model without single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers grouped into minor allele frequency-linkage disequilibrium (MAF-LD) annotation categories. For height, the prediction accuracy R2 was 47% in a UK Biobank holdout sample, which was 76% of the estimated [Formula: see text]. We then extend our GMRM prediction model to provide mixed-linear model association (MLMA) SNP marker estimates for genome-wide association (GWAS) discovery, which increased the independent loci detected to 16,162 in unrelated UK Biobank individuals, compared to 10,550 from BoltLMM and 10,095 from Regenie, a 62 and 65% increase, respectively. The average [Formula: see text] value of the leading markers increased by 15.24 (SE 0.41) for every 1% increase in prediction accuracy gained over a baseline BayesR model across the traits. Thus, we show that modeling genetic associations accounting for MAF and LD differences among SNP markers, and incorporating prior knowledge of genomic function, is important for both genomic prediction and discovery in large-scale individual-level studies. </li> <li>CITATION : Orliac EJ, Trejo Banos D, Ojavee SE, L\u00e4ll K, ...&amp;, Robinson MR.

A considerable proportion of people carry a high genetic risk but evade the disease. On the other hand, some individuals with a low risk of eventually developing the disease. We hypothesized that unknown counterfactors might be involved in reversing the PRS prediction, which might provide new insights into the pathogenesis, prevention, and early intervention of diseases. Methods: We built a novel computational framework to identify genetically-regulated pathways (GRPas) using PRS-based stratification for each cohort. We curated two AD cohorts with genotyping data; the discovery (disc) and the replication (rep) datasets include 2722 and 2854 individuals, respectively. First, we calculated the optimized PRS model based on the three recent AD GWAS summary statistics for each cohort. Then, we stratified the individuals by their PRS and clinical diagnosis into six biologically meaningful PRS strata, such as AD cases with low/high risk and cognitively normal (CN) with low/high risk. Lastly, we imputed individual genetically-regulated expression (GReX) and identified differential GReX and GRPas between risk strata using gene-set enrichment and variational analyses in two models, with and without APOE effects. An orthogonality test was further conducted to verify those GRPas are independent of PRS risk. To verify the generalizability of other polygenic diseases, we further applied a default model of GRPa-PRS for schizophrenia (SCZ). Results: For each stratum, we conducted the same procedures in both the disc and rep datasets for comparison. In AD, we identified several well-known AD-related pathways, including amyloid-beta clearance, tau protein binding, and astrocyte response to oxidative stress. Additionally, we discovered resilience-related GRPs that are orthogonal to AD PRS, such as the calcium signaling pathway and divalent inorganic cation homeostasis. In SCZ, pathways related to mitochondrial function and muscle development were highlighted. Finally, our GRPa-PRS method identified more consistent differential pathways compared to another variant-based pathway PRS method. Conclusions: We developed a framework, GRPa-PRS, to systematically explore the differential GReX and GRPas among individuals stratified by their estimated PRS. The GReX-level comparison among those strata unveiled new insights into the pathways associated with disease risk and resilience. Our framework is extendable to other polygenic complex diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Li X, Fernandes BS, Liu A, Chen J, ...&amp;, Dai Y.

However, most polygenic score (PGS) approaches do not incorporate non-additive effects. Here, we present GenoBoost, a flexible PGS modeling framework capable of considering both additive and non-additive effects, specifically focusing on genetic dominance. Building on statistical boosting theory, we derive provably optimal GenoBoost scores and provide its efficient implementation for analyzing large-scale cohorts. We benchmark it against seven commonly used PGS methods and demonstrate its competitive predictive performance. GenoBoost is ranked the best for four traits and second-best for three traits among twelve tested disease outcomes in UK Biobank. We reveal that GenoBoost improves prediction for autoimmune diseases by incorporating non-additive effects localized in the MHC locus and, more broadly, works best in less polygenic traits. We further demonstrate that GenoBoost can infer the mode of genetic inheritance without requiring prior knowledge. For example, GenoBoost finds non-zero genetic dominance effects for 602 of 900 selected genetic variants, resulting in 2.5% improvements in predicting psoriasis cases. Lastly, we show that GenoBoost can prioritize genetic loci with genetic dominance not previously reported in the GWAS catalog. Our results highlight the increased accuracy and biological insights from incorporating non-additive effects in PGS models. </li> <li>CITATION : Ohta R, Tanigawa Y, Suzuki Y, Kellis M, ...&amp;, Morishita S.

The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase. </li> <li>CITATION : Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ, Yang J, Finucane HK, Gusev A, ...&amp;, Price AL.

Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, including coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank (avg N = 373 K as training data). LDpred-funct attained a +4.6% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2 = 0.144; highest R2 = 0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (N = 1107 K) increased prediction R2 to 0.431. Our results show that incorporating functional priors improves polygenic prediction accuracy, consistent with the functional architecture of complex traits. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : M\u00e1rquez-Luna C, Gazal S, Loh PR, Kim SS, ...&amp;, Price AL.

LDpred is a popular method for deriving polygenic scores based on summary statistics and a matrix of correlation between genetic variants. However, LDpred has limitations that may reduce its predictive performance. RESULTS: Here, we present LDpred2, a new version of LDpred that addresses these issues. We also provide two new options in LDpred2: a 'sparse' option that can learn effects that are exactly 0, and an 'auto' option that directly learns the two LDpred parameters from data. We benchmark predictive performance of LDpred2 against the previous version on simulated and real data, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and predictive accuracy compared to LDpred1. We then show that LDpred2 also outperforms other polygenic score methods recently developed, with a mean AUC over the 8 real traits analyzed here of 65.1%, compared to 63.8% for lassosum, 62.9% for PRS-CS and 61.5% for SBayesR. Note that LDpred2 provides more accurate polygenic scores when run genome-wide, instead of per chromosome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: LDpred2 is implemented in R package bigsnpr.

LDpred2-auto can infer the two parameters from the LDpred model, the SNP heritability h2 and polygenicity p, so that it does not require an additional validation dataset to choose best-performing parameters. The main aim of this paper is to properly validate the use of LDpred2-auto for inferring multiple genetic parameters. Here, we present a new version of LDpred2-auto that adds an optional third parameter \u03b1 to its model, for modeling negative selection. We then validate the inference of these three parameters (or two, when using the previous model). We also show that LDpred2-auto provides per-variant probabilities of being causal that are well calibrated and can therefore be used for fine-mapping purposes. We also introduce a formula to infer the out-of-sample predictive performance r2 of the resulting PGS directly from the Gibbs sampler of LDpred2-auto. Finally, we extend the set of HapMap3 variants recommended to use with LDpred2 with 37% more variants to improve the coverage of this set, and we show that this new set of variants captures 12% more heritability and provides 6% more predictive performance, on average, in UK Biobank analyses. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Priv\u00e9 F, Albi\u00f1ana C, Arbel J, Pasaniuc B, ...&amp;, Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ.

SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from a reference panel of 11 million SNPs, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities (as a fraction of the reference panel) ranging from \u2243 2 \u00d7 10-5 to \u2243 4 \u00d7 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics. </li> <li>CITATION : Holland D, Frei O, Desikan R, Fan CC, ...&amp;, Dale AM.

The BLUP mathematical model, which consists of a single random effect term, was adequate when kinships were measured from pedigrees. However, when genome-wide SNPs are used to measure kinships, the BLUP model implicitly assumes that all SNPs have the same effect-size distribution, which is a severe and unnecessary limitation. We propose MultiBLUP, which extends the BLUP model to include multiple random effects, allowing greatly improved prediction when the random effects correspond to classes of SNPs with distinct effect-size variances. The SNP classes can be specified in advance, for example, based on SNP functional annotations, and we also provide an adaptive procedure for determining a suitable partition of SNPs. We apply MultiBLUP to genome-wide association data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (seven diseases), and from much larger studies of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, finding that it consistently provides better prediction than alternative methods. Moreover, MultiBLUP is computationally very efficient; for the largest data set, which includes 12,678 individuals and 1.5 M SNPs, the total analysis can be run on a single desktop PC in less than a day and can be parallelized to run even faster. Tools to perform MultiBLUP are freely available in our software LDAK. </li> <li>CITATION : Speed D, Balding DJ.

Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large.

However, providing polygenic score predictions on the absolute scale is an important step for their safe interpretation. We have developed a method to convert polygenic scores to the absolute scale for binary and normally distributed phenotypes. This method uses summary statistics, requiring only the area-under-the-ROC curve (AUC) or variance explained (R2) by the polygenic score, and the prevalence of binary phenotypes, or mean and standard deviation of normally distributed phenotypes. Polygenic scores are converted using normal distribution theory. We also evaluate methods for estimating polygenic score AUC/R2 from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone. We validate the absolute risk conversion and AUC/R2 estimation using data for eight binary and three continuous phenotypes in the UK Biobank sample. When the AUC/R2 of the polygenic score is known, the observed and estimated absolute values were highly concordant. Estimates of AUC/R2 from the lassosum pseudovalidation method were most similar to the observed AUC/R2 values, though estimated values deviated substantially from the observed for autoimmune disorders. This study enables accurate interpretation of polygenic scores using only summary statistics, providing a useful tool for educational and clinical purposes. Furthermore, we have created interactive webtools implementing the conversion to the absolute ( https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/PRS_to_Abs_tool.html ). Several further barriers must be addressed before clinical implementation of polygenic scores, such as ensuring target individuals are well represented by the GWAS sample. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Pain O, Gillett AC, Austin JC, Folkersen L, ...&amp;, Lewis CM.

The development of accurate risk prediction models is hindered by the wide diversity of genetic architecture across different traits, limited access to individual level data for training and parameter tuning, and the demand for computational resources. To overcome the limitations of the most existing methods that make explicit assumptions on the underlying genetic architecture and need a separate validation data set for parameter tuning, we develop a summary statistics-based nonparametric method that does not rely on validation datasets to tune parameters. In our implementation, we refine the commonly used likelihood assumption to deal with the discrepancy between summary statistics and external reference panel. We also leverage the block structure of the reference linkage disequilibrium matrix for implementation of a parallel algorithm.

These polygenic risk score (PRS) methods use a multiple linear regression framework to infer joint effect sizes of all genetic variants on the trait. Among the subset of PRS methods that operate on GWAS summary statistics, sparse Bayesian methods have shown competitive predictive ability. However, most existing Bayesian approaches employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which are computationally inefficient and do not scale favorably to higher dimensions, for posterior inference. Here, we introduce variational inference of polygenic risk scores (VIPRS), a Bayesian summary statistics-based PRS method that utilizes variational inference techniques to approximate the posterior distribution for the effect sizes. Our experiments with 36 simulation configurations and 12 real phenotypes from the UK Biobank dataset demonstrated that VIPRS is consistently competitive with the state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy while being more than twice as fast as popular MCMC-based approaches. This performance advantage is robust across a variety of genetic architectures, SNP heritabilities, and independent GWAS cohorts. In addition to its competitive accuracy on the \"White British\" samples, VIPRS showed improved transferability when applied to other ethnic groups, with up to 1.7-fold increase in R2 among individuals of Nigerian ancestry for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. To illustrate its scalability, we applied VIPRS to a dataset of 9.6 million genetic markers, which conferred further improvements in prediction accuracy for highly polygenic traits, such as height. </li> <li>CITATION : Zabad S, Gravel S, Li Y.

They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred. </li> <li>CITATION : Mak TSH, Porsch RM, Choi SW, Zhou X, ...&amp;, Sham PC.

First, we present an overview of possible misspecifications that come with GWAS summary statistics. Then, in both simulations and real-data analyses, we show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications in the GWAS summary statistics. One important motivation for us is to improve the predictive performance of polygenic scores built from these summary statistics. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of reporting standards for GWAS summary statistics, this additional information is not systematically reported. We also show that using well-matched linkage disequilibrium (LD) references can improve model fit and translate into more accurate prediction. Finally, we discuss how to make polygenic score methods such as lassosum and LDpred2 more robust to these misspecifications to improve their predictive power. </li> <li>CITATION : Priv\u00e9 F, Arbel J, Aschard H, Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ.

PRSs are generally derived based on summary statistics from large meta-analyses of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, it is now common for researchers to have access to large individual-level data as well, such as the UK Biobank data. To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been explored how best to combine both types of data (summary statistics and individual-level data) to optimize polygenic prediction. The most widely used approach to combine data is the meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics (meta-GWAS), but we show that it does not always provide the most accurate PRS. Through simulations and using 12 real case-control and quantitative traits from both iPSYCH and UK Biobank along with external GWAS summary statistics, we compare meta-GWAS with two alternative data-combining approaches, stacked clumping and thresholding (SCT) and meta-PRS. We find that, when large individual-level data are available, the linear combination of PRSs (meta-PRS) is both a simple alternative to meta-GWAS and often more accurate. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Albi\u00f1ana C, Grove J, McGrath JJ, Agerbo E, ...&amp;, Vilhj\u00e1lmsson BJ.

Drawing on the input of experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation and policy, this comprehensive reporting framework defines the minimal information that is needed to interpret and evaluate PRSs, especially with respect to downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of study populations, statistical methods for the development and validation of PRSs and considerations for the potential limitations of these scores. In addition, we emphasize the need for data availability and transparency, and we encourage researchers to deposit and share PRSs through the PGS Catalog to facilitate reproducibility and comparative benchmarking. By providing these criteria in a structured format that builds on existing standards and ontologies, the use of this framework in publishing PRSs will facilitate translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practice. </li> <li>CITATION : Wand H, Lambert SA, Tamburro C, Iacocca MA, ...&amp;, Wojcik GL.

While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation-genetic liability-has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining </li> <li>CITATION : Choi SW, Mak TS, O'Reilly PF.

Because of the high cost of genotyping hundreds of thousands of markers on thousands of subjects, genome-wide association studies often follow a staged design in which a proportion (pi(samples)) of the available samples are genotyped on a large number of markers in stage 1, and a proportion (pi(samples)) of these markers are later followed up by genotyping them on the remaining samples in stage 2. The standard strategy for analyzing such two-stage data is to view stage 2 as a replication study and focus on findings that reach statistical significance when stage 2 data are considered alone. We demonstrate that the alternative strategy of jointly analyzing the data from both stages almost always results in increased power to detect genetic association, despite the need to use more stringent significance levels, even when effect sizes differ between the two stages. We recommend joint analysis for all two-stage genome-wide association studies, especially when a relatively large proportion of the samples are genotyped in stage 1 (pi(samples) &gt;or= 0.30), and a relatively large proportion of markers are selected for follow-up in stage 2 (pi(markers) &gt;or= 0.01). </li> <li>CITATION : Skol AD, Scott LJ, Abecasis GR, Boehnke M.

A range of power estimates based on simulations and specific parameters for two-stage least squares (2SLS) MR analyses based on continuous variables has previously been published. However there are presently no specific equations or software tools one can implement for calculating power of a given MR study. Using asymptotic theory, we show that in the case of continuous variables and a single instrument, for example a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or multiple SNP predictor, statistical power for a fixed sample size is a function of two parameters: the proportion of variation in the exposure variable explained by the genetic predictor and the true causal association between the exposure and outcome variable. We demonstrate that power for 2SLS MR can be derived using the non-centrality parameter (NCP) of the statistical test that is employed to test whether the 2SLS regression coefficient is zero. We show that the previously published power estimates from simulations can be represented theoretically using this NCP-based approach, with similar estimates observed when the simulation-based estimates are compared with our NCP-based approach. General equations for calculating statistical power for 2SLS MR using the NCP are provided in this note, and we implement the calculations in a web-based application. </li> <li>CITATION : Brion MJ, Shakhbazov K, Visscher PM.

However, comparisons to conventional immunoassays remain underexplored, leaving investigators unsure when cross-assay comparisons are appropriate. The correlation of results from immunoassays with relative protein quantification is explored by SOMAscan. For 63 proteins assessed in two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cohorts, subpopulations and intermediate outcome measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), and COPDGene, using myriad rules based medicine multiplex immunoassays and SOMAscan, Spearman correlation coefficients range from -0.13 to 0.97, with a median correlation coefficient of \u22480.5 and consistent results across cohorts. A similar range is observed for immunoassays in the population-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and for other assays in COPDGene and SPIROMICS. Comparisons of relative quantification from the antibody-based Olink platform and SOMAscan in a small cohort of myocardial infarction patients also show a wide correlation range. Finally, cis pQTL data, mass spectrometry aptamer confirmation, and other publicly available data are integrated to assess relationships with observed correlations. Correlation between proteomics assays shows a wide range and should be carefully considered when comparing and meta-analyzing proteomics data across assays and studies. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor </li> <li>CITATION : Raffield LM, Dang H, Pratte KA, Jacobson S, ...&amp;, NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Consortium.

The nucleic acid proximity-based methods proximity ligation and proximity extension assays have, with their dual reporters, shown potential to relieve the shortcomings of antibodies and their inherent cross-reactivity in multiplex protein quantification applications. The aim of the present study was to develop a robust 96-plex immunoassay based on the proximity extension assay (PEA) for improved high throughput detection of protein biomarkers. This was enabled by: (1) a modified design leading to a reduced number of pipetting steps compared to the existing PEA protocol, as well as improved intra-assay precision; (2) a new enzymatic system that uses a hyper-thermostabile enzyme, Pwo, for uniting the two probes allowing for room temperature addition of all reagents and improved the sensitivity; (3) introduction of an inter-plate control and a new normalization procedure leading to improved inter-assay precision (reproducibility). The multiplex proximity extension assay was found to perform well in complex samples, such as serum and plasma, and also in xenografted mice and resuspended dried blood spots, consuming only 1 \u00b5L sample per test. All-in-all, the development of the current multiplex technique is a step toward robust high throughput protein marker discovery and research. </li> <li>CITATION : Assarsson E, Lundberg M, Holmquist G, Bj\u00f6rkesten J, ...&amp;, Fredriksson S.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present a new aptamer-based proteomic technology for biomarker discovery capable of simultaneously measuring thousands of proteins from small sample volumes (15 \u00b5L of serum or plasma). Our current assay measures 813 proteins with low limits of detection (1 pM median), 7 logs of overall dynamic range (~100 fM-1 \u00b5M), and 5% median coefficient of variation. This technology is enabled by a new generation of aptamers that contain chemically modified nucleotides, which greatly expand the physicochemical diversity of the large randomized nucleic acid libraries from which the aptamers are selected. Proteins in complex matrices such as plasma are measured with a process that transforms a signature of protein concentrations into a corresponding signature of DNA aptamer concentrations, which is quantified on a DNA microarray. Our assay takes advantage of the dual nature of aptamers as both folded protein-binding entities with defined shapes and unique nucleotide sequences recognizable by specific hybridization probes. To demonstrate the utility of our proteomics biomarker discovery technology, we applied it to a clinical study of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified two well known CKD biomarkers as well as an additional 58 potential CKD biomarkers. These results demonstrate the potential utility of our technology to rapidly discover unique protein signatures characteristic of various disease states. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We describe a versatile and powerful tool that allows large-scale comparison of proteome profiles among discrete populations. This unbiased and highly multiplexed search engine will enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in a manner that is unencumbered by our incomplete knowledge of biology, thereby helping to advance the next generation of evidence-based medicine. </li> <li>CITATION : Gold L, Ayers D, Bertino J, Bock C, ...&amp;, Zichi D.

Despite this constraint, SELEX has enjoyed considerable success over the past quarter of a century as a result of the enormous size of starting libraries and conformational richness of nucleic acids. With judicious introduction of functional groups absent in natural nucleic acids, the \"diversity gap\" between nucleic acid-based ligands and protein-based ligands can be substantially bridged, to generate a new class of ligands that represent the best of both worlds. We have explored the effect of various functional groups at the 5-position of uracil and found that hydrophobic aromatic side chains have the most profound influence on the success rate of SELEX and allow the identification of ligands with very low dissociation rate constants (named Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers or SOMAmers). Such modified nucleotides create unique intramolecular motifs and make direct contacts with proteins. Importantly, SOMAmers engage their protein targets with surfaces that have significantly more hydrophobic character compared with conventional aptamers, thereby increasing the range of epitopes that are available for binding. These improvements have enabled us to build a collection of SOMAmers to over 3,000 human proteins encompassing major families such as growth factors, cytokines, enzymes, hormones, and receptors, with additional SOMAmers aimed at pathogen and rodent proteins. Such a large and growing collection of exquisite affinity reagents expands the scope of possible applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. </li> <li>CITATION : Rohloff JC, Gelinas AD, Jarvis TC, Ochsner UA, ...&amp;, Janjic N.

On the basis of previous work, we describe exact tests of HWE together with efficient computational methods for their implementation.

Applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past ~2000 to 3000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and the major histocompatibility complex, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes.

Moreover, we identify shifts associated with other complex traits, suggesting that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans. </li> <li>CITATION : Field Y, Boyle EA, Telis N, Gao Z, ...&amp;, Pritchard JK.

Here, we describe a flexible and robust approach based on the site frequency spectrum to estimate the fraction of deleterious and adaptive variants from large-scale sequencing data sets. We applied our method to approximately 1 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified in high-coverage exome sequences of 6515 individuals. We estimate that the fraction of deleterious nonsynonymous SNVs is higher than previously reported; quantify the effects of genomic context, codon bias, chromatin accessibility, and number of protein-protein interactions on deleterious protein-coding SNVs; and identify pathways and networks that have likely been influenced by positive selection. Furthermore, we show that the fraction of deleterious nonsynonymous SNVs is significantly higher for Mendelian versus complex disease loci and in exons harboring dominant versus recessive Mendelian mutations. In summary, as genome-scale sequencing data accumulate in progressively larger sample sizes, our method will enable increasingly high-resolution inferences into the characteristics and determinants of non-neutral variation. </li> <li>CITATION : Moon S, Akey JM.

We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest approximately 250 signals of recent selection in each population. </li> <li>CITATION : Voight BF, Kudaravalli S, Wen X, Pritchard JK.

Computer simulation is a nice tool to test the performances of various GWAS methods under certain scenarios. Existing tools are either inefficient in terms of computation and memory efficiency or inconvenient to use to simulate big, realistic genotype data and phenotype data to evaluate available GWAS methods. RESULTS: Here, we present a GWAS simulation tool named G2P that can be used to simulate genotype data, phenotype data and perform power evaluation of GWAS methods. G2P is a user-friendly tool with all functions is provided in both graphical user interface and pipeline manners and it is available for Windows, Mac and Linux environments. Furthermore, G2P achieves maximum efficiency in terms of both memory usage and simulation speed; with G2P, the simulation of genotype data that includes 1 000 000 samples and 2 000 000 markers can be accomplished in 5 h.

GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation.

Although a number of high-quality genetic simulators have been developed, many of them require advanced knowledge in population genetics or in computation to be used effectively. In addition, generating simulated data in the context of family-based studies demands sophisticated methods and advanced computer programming. RESULTS: To address these issues, we propose a new user-friendly and integrated R package, sim1000G, which simulates variants in genomic regions among unrelated individuals or among families. The only input needed is a raw phased Variant Call Format (VCF) file. Haplotypes are extracted to compute linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the simulated genomic regions and for the generation of new genotype data among unrelated individuals. The covariance across variants is used to preserve the LD structure of the original population. Pedigrees of arbitrary sizes are generated by modeling recombination events with sim1000G. To illustrate the application of sim1000G, various scenarios are presented assuming unrelated individuals from a single population or two distinct populations, or alternatively for three-generation pedigree data. Sim1000G can capture allele frequency diversity, short and long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and subtle population differences in LD structure without the need of any tuning parameters. CONCLUSION: Sim1000G fills a gap in the vast area of genetic variants simulators by its simplicity and independence from external tools. Currently, it is one of the few simulation packages completely integrated into R and able to simulate multiple genetic variants among unrelated individuals and within families. Its implementation will facilitate the application and development of computational methods for association studies with both rare and common variants. </li> <li>CITATION : Dimitromanolakis A, Xu J, Krol A, Briollais L.

Ideal validation for such methods is application to simulated data, where some 'truth' is known. As GWAS increase in size, so does the computational complexity of such evaluations; standard practice repeatedly simulates and analyses genotype data for all individuals in an example study. RESULTS: We have developed a novel method based on an alternative approach, directly simulating GWAS summary data, without individual data as an intermediate step. We mathematically derive the expected statistics for any set of causal variants and their effect sizes, conditional upon control haplotype frequencies (available from public reference datasets). Simulation of GWAS summary output can be conducted independently of sample size by simulating random variates about these expected values. Across a range of scenarios, our method, produces very similar output to that from simulating individual genotypes with a substantial gain in speed even for modest sample sizes. Fast simulation of GWAS summary statistics will enable more complete and rapid evaluation of summary statistic methods as well as opening new potential avenues of research in fine mapping and gene set enrichment analysis.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) have been proposed to mitigate this gap by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data with GWAS data.

Understanding the biological functions of these identified SNP associations requires identifying disease/trait relevant tissues or cell types. Here, we develop a network method, CoCoNet, to facilitate the identification of trait-relevant tissues or cell types. Different from existing approaches, CoCoNet incorporates tissue-specific gene co-expression networks constructed from either bulk or single cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies with GWAS data for trait-tissue inference. In particular, CoCoNet relies on a covariance regression network model to express gene-level effect measurements for the given GWAS trait as a function of the tissue-specific co-expression adjacency matrix. With a composite likelihood-based inference algorithm, CoCoNet is scalable to tens of thousands of genes. We validate the performance of CoCoNet through extensive simulations. We apply CoCoNet for an in-depth analysis of four neurological disorders and four autoimmune diseases, where we integrate the corresponding GWASs with bulk RNAseq data from 38 tissues and single cell RNAseq data from 10 cell types. In the real data applications, we show how CoCoNet can help identify specific glial cell types relevant for neurological disorders and identify disease-targeted colon tissues as relevant for autoimmune diseases. </li> <li>CITATION : Shang L, Smith JA, Zhou X.

Emerging evidence suggests that the function of trait-associated variants likely acts in a tissue- or cell-type-specific fashion. Yet, it remains challenging to prioritize trait-relevant tissues or cell types to elucidate disease etiology. Here, we present EPIC (cEll tyPe enrIChment), a statistical framework that relates large-scale GWAS summary statistics to cell-type-specific gene expression measurements from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We derive powerful gene-level test statistics for common and rare variants, separately and jointly, and adopt generalized least squares to prioritize trait-relevant cell types while accounting for the correlation structures both within and between genes. Using enrichment of loci associated with four lipid traits in the liver and enrichment of loci associated with three neurological disorders in the brain as ground truths, we show that EPIC outperforms existing methods. We apply our framework to multiple scRNA-seq datasets from different platforms and identify cell types underlying type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. The enrichment is replicated using independent GWAS and scRNA-seq datasets and further validated using PubMed search and existing bulk case-control testing results. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : Wang R, Lin DY, Jiang Y.

In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detected a broad range of enrichments that recapitulated known biology. In our brain-specific analysis, significant enrichments included an enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder, and excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index.

However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ </li> <li>CITATION : de Leeuw CA, Mooij JM, Heskes T, Posthuma D.

However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet limited work has linked single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and gene expression data. RolyPoly is designed to use expression data from either bulk tissue or single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, we demonstrated RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validated previously known tissue-trait associations. We discovered a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer disease and an association between schizophrenia and oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene to reflect the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease were significantly enriched with genes ranked highly by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits. </li> <li>CITATION : Calderon D, Bhaskar A, Knowles DA, Golan D, ...&amp;, Pritchard JK.

SCARlink outperformed existing gene scoring methods for imputing gene expression from chromatin accessibility across high-coverage multi-ome datasets while giving comparable to improved performance on low-coverage datasets. Shapley value analysis on trained models identified cell-type-specific gene enhancers that are validated by promoter capture Hi-C and are 11\u00d7 to 15\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 to 12\u00d7 enriched in fine-mapped eQTLs and fine-mapped genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants, respectively.

To overcome these challenges, we present SCAVENGE, a computational algorithm that uses network propagation to map causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation, applying the method to blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, to monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that predispose to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell resolution but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data. </li> <li>CITATION : Yu F, Cato LD, Weng C, Liggett LA, ...&amp;, Sankaran VG.

However, co-regulation of genetic effects on gene expression across tissues impedes distinguishing biologically causal tissues from tagging tissues. In the present study, we introduce tissue co-regulation score regression (TCSC), which disentangles causal tissues from tagging tissues by regressing gene-disease association statistics (from transcriptome-wide association studies) on tissue co-regulation scores, reflecting correlations of predicted gene expression across genes and tissues. We applied TCSC to 78 diseases/traits (average n = 302,000) and gene expression prediction models for 48 GTEx tissues. TCSC identified 21 causal tissue-trait pairs at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR), including well-established findings, biologically plausible new findings (for example, aorta artery and glaucoma) and increased specificity of known tissue-trait associations (for example, subcutaneous adipose, but not visceral adipose, and high-density lipoprotein). TCSC also identified 17 causal tissue-trait covariance pairs at 5% FDR. In conclusion, TCSC is a precise method for distinguishing causal tissues from tagging tissues. </li> <li>CITATION : Amariuta T, Siewert-Rocks K, Price AL.

Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. In the present study, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, epigenomic SNP-to-gene maps and genome-wide association study summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell-disease relationships, including \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease-dependent immune cell-type programs were associated, whereas only disease-dependent epithelial cell programs were prominent, suggesting a role in disease response rather than initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease. </li> <li>CITATION : Jagadeesh KA, Dey KK, Montoro DT, Mohan R, ...&amp;, Regev A.

We introduce single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), an approach that links scRNA-seq with polygenic disease risk at single-cell resolution, independent of annotated cell types. scDRS identifies cells exhibiting excess expression across disease-associated genes implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied scDRS to 74 diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known cell-type-disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes. </li> <li>CITATION : Zhang MJ, Hou K, Dey KK, Sakaue S, ...&amp;, Price AL.

Here, we develop a new method, scGWAS, which effectively leverages scRNA-seq data to achieve two goals: (1) to infer the cell types in which the disease-associated genes manifest and (2) to construct cellular modules which imply disease-specific activation of different processes. RESULTS: scGWAS only utilizes the average gene expression for each cell type followed by virtual search processes to construct the null distributions of module scores, making it scalable to large scRNA-seq datasets. We demonstrated scGWAS in 40 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets (average sample size N \u2248 154,000) using 18 scRNA-seq datasets from nine major human/mouse tissues (totaling 1.08 million cells) and identified 2533 trait and cell-type associations, each with significant modules for further investigation. The module genes were validated using disease or clinically annotated references from ClinVar, OMIM, and pLI variants. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the trait-cell type associations identified by scGWAS, while generally constrained to trait-tissue associations, could recapitulate many well-studied relationships and also reveal novel relationships, providing insights into the unsolved trait-tissue associations. Moreover, in each specific cell type, the associations with different traits were often mediated by different sets of risk genes, implying disease-specific activation of driving processes. In summary, scGWAS is a powerful tool for exploring the genetic basis of complex diseases at the cell type level using single-cell expression data. </li> <li>CITATION : Jia P, Hu R, Yan F, Dai Y, ...&amp;, Zhao Z.

This has increased the need for graphic tools that allow the concurrent visualization of genomes and feature-associated multi-omics data on single publication-ready plots. RESULTS: We present chromoMap, an R package, developed for the construction of interactive visualizations of chromosomes/chromosomal regions, mapping of any chromosomal feature with known coordinates (i.e., protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNAs, microsatellites, etc.), and chromosomal regional characteristics (i.e. genomic feature density, gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, etc.) of organisms with a genome assembly. ChromoMap can also integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) in relation to their occurrence across chromosomes. ChromoMap takes tab-delimited files (BED like) or alternatively R objects to specify the genomic co-ordinates of the chromosomes and elements to annotate. Rendered chromosomes are composed of continuous windows of a given range, which, on hover, display detailed information about the elements annotated within that range. By adjusting parameters of a single function, users can generate a variety of plots that can either be saved as static image or as HTML documents. CONCLUSIONS: ChromoMap's flexibility allows for concurrent visualization of genomic data in each strand of a given chromosome, or of more than one homologous chromosome; allowing the comparison of multi-omic data between genotypes (e.g. species, varieties, etc.) or between homologous chromosomes of phased diploid/polyploid genomes. chromoMap is an extensive tool that can be potentially used in various bioinformatics analysis pipelines for genomic visualization of multi-omics data. </li> <li>COPYRIGHT : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 </li> <li>CITATION : Anand L, Rodriguez Lopez CM.

Plot creation process is inspired in R base graphics, with a main function creating karyoplots with no data and multiple additional functions, including custom functions written by the end-user, adding data and other graphical elements. This approach allows the creation of highly customizable plots from arbitrary data with complete freedom on data positioning and representation.

The geographic distribution can shed light on where an allele first arose, what populations it has spread to, and in turn on how migration, genetic drift, and natural selection have acted. The geographic distribution of a genetic variant can also be of great utility for medical/clinical geneticists and collectively many genetic variants can reveal population structure. Here we develop an interactive visualization tool for rapidly displaying the geographic distribution of genetic variants. Through a REST API and dynamic front-end, the Geography of Genetic Variants (GGV) browser ( http://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/ ) provides maps of allele frequencies in populations distributed across the globe. Availability and Implementation: GGV is implemented as a website ( http://popgen.uchicago.edu/ggv/ ) which employs an API to access frequency data ( http://popgen.uchicago.edu/freq_api/ ).

Interactive and powerful tools are needed to calculate population-specific LD estimates for integrative genomics research. LDlink is an interactive suite of web-based tools developed to query germline variants in 1000 Genomes Project population groups of interest and generate interactive tables and plots of LD estimates. As an expansion to this resource, we have developed an R package, LDlinkR, designed to rapidly calculate statistics for large lists of variants and LD attributes that eliminates the time needed to perform repetitive requests from the web-based LDlink tool. LDlinkR accelerates genomic research by providing efficient and user-friendly functions to programmatically interrogate and download pairwise LD estimates from expansive lists of genetic variants.

Here, we present LDlink, a web-based collection of bioinformatic modules that query single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in population groups of interest to generate haplotype tables and interactive plots. Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Phase 3 haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of LD, searching for proxies in high LD, and enumerating all observed haplotypes. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci by focusing on output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants.

The application is designed for interactive browser-based visualization of the putative functional relevance of SNVs by biologists who are not necessarily experts either in bioinformatics or protein structure. Users may submit batches of several thousand SNVs and review all protein structures that cover the SNVs, including available functional annotations such as binding sites, mutagenesis experiments, and common polymorphisms. Multiple SNVs may be mapped onto each structure, enabling 3D visualization of SNV clusters and their relationship to functionally annotated positions. We illustrate the utility of MuPIT interactive in rationalizing the impact of selected polymorphisms in the PharmGKB database, somatic mutations identified in the Cancer Genome Atlas study of invasive breast carcinomas, and rare variants identified in the exome sequencing project.

Here we present Protter, a web-based tool that supports interactive protein data analysis and hypothesis generation by visualizing both annotated sequence features and experimental proteomic data in the context of protein topology. Protter supports numerous proteomic file formats and automatically integrates a variety of reference protein annotation sources, which can be readily extended via modular plug-ins. A built-in export function produces publication-quality customized protein illustrations, also for large datasets. Visualizations of surfaceome datasets show the specific utility of Protter for the integrated visual analysis of membrane proteins and peptide selection for targeted proteomics.
