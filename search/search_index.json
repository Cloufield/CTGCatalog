To leverage the relative benefits of different strategies, we undertook a combined approach of genotyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a population-based study of 6,400 individuals from a geographically defined rural community in South-West Uganda. We present data from 4,778 individuals with genotypes for ~2.2 million SNPs from the Uganda GWAS resource (UGWAS), and sequence data on up to 1,978 individuals spanning 41.5M SNPs and 4.5M indels (UG2G); 343 individuals overlap between the two datasets.

The project was based on LC-MS/MS by utilizing of high resolution and high accuracy Fourier transform mass spectrometry. All mass spectrometry data including precursors and HCD-derived fragments were acquired on the Orbitrap mass analyzers in the high-high mode. Currently, the HPM contains direct evidence of translation of a number of protein products derived from over 17,000 human genes covering >84% of the annotated protein-coding genes in humans based on >290,000 non-redundant peptide identifications of multiple organs/tissues and cell types from individuals with clinically defined healthy tissues. This includes 17 adult tissues, 6 primary hematopoietic cells and 7 fetal tissues. The HPM portal provides an interactive web resource by reorganizing the label-free quantitative proteomic data set in a simple graphical view. In addition, the portal provides selected reaction monitoring (SRM) information for all peptides identified. CITATION:Kim, M. S., Pinto, S. M., Getnet, D., Nirujogi, R. S., Manda, S.

PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent visualization, annotation and storage of results.

EMMAX FULLNAME:efficient mixed-model association eXpedited SHORTNAME:EMMAX URL: https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/EMMAX DESCRIPTION: EMMAX is a statistical test for large scale human or model organism association mapping accounting for the sample structure. In addition to the computational efficiency obtained by EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes advantage of the fact that each loci explains only a small fraction of complex traits, which allows us to avoid repetitive variance component estimation procedure, resulting in a significant amount of increase in computational time of association mapping using mixed model. CITATION: GEMMA FULLNAME: genome-wide efficient mixed-model association SHORTNAME: GEMMA DESCRIPTION: GEMMA is the software implementing the Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithm for a standard linear mixed model and some of its close relatives for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It fits a standard linear mixed model (LMM) to account for population stratification and sample structure for single marker association tests. It fits a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model (BSLMM) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes explained (PVE) by typed genotypes (i.e. chip heritability), predicting phenotypes, and identifying associated markers by jointly modeling all markers while controlling for population structure. It is computationally efficient for large scale GWAS and uses freely available open-source numerical libraries.

It accounts for sample relatedness and is feasible for genetic association tests in large cohorts and biobanks (N > 400,000).

Here we present PAINTOR (Probabilistic Annotation INtegraTOR), a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with genomic functional annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. The main output of PAINTOR are probabilities for every variant to be causal that can be used for prioritization in functional assays to establish biological causality.

KEY WORDS: Empirical Bayes prior MR-MEGA SHORT NAME: MR-MEGA FULL NAME: Meta-Regression of Multi-AncEstry Genetic Association YEAR: 2017 DESCRIPTION: MR-MEGA (Meta-Regression of Multi-AncEstry Genetic Association) is a tool to detect and fine-map complex trait association signals via multi-ancestry meta-regression. This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007]. Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates. The flexibility of this model enables partitioning of the heterogeneity into components due to ancestry and residual variation, which would be expected to improve fine-mapping resolution.

The main output of PAINTOR are probabilities for every variant to be causal that can be used for prioritization in functional assays to establish biological causality.

This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007]. Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates. The flexibility of this model enables partitioning of the heterogeneity into components due to ancestry and residual variation, which would be expected to improve fine-mapping resolution.

SMR SMR SHORT NAME: SMR FULL NAME:\u3000Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization DESCRIPTION:\u3000The SMR software tool was originally developed to implement the SMR & HEIDI methods to test for pleiotropic association between the expression level of a gene and a complex trait of interest using summary-level data from GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies (Zhu et al. 2016 Nature Genetics). The SMR & HEIDI methodology can be interpreted as an analysis to test if the effect size of a SNP on the phenotype is mediated by gene expression. This tool can therefore be used to prioritize genes underlying GWAS hits for follow-up functional studies. The methods are applicable to all kinds of molecular QTL (xQTL) data, including DNA methylation QTL (mQTL) and protein abundance QTL (pQTL).

This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007]. Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates. The flexibility of this model enables partitioning of the heterogeneity into components due to ancestry and residual variation, which would be expected to improve fine-mapping resolution.

This approach uses genome-wide metrics of diversity between populations to derive axes of genetic variation via multi-dimensional scaling [Purcell 2007]. Allelic effects of a variant across GWAS, weighted by their corresponding standard errors, can then be modelled in a linear regression framework, including the axes of genetic variation as covariates. The flexibility of this model enables partitioning of the heterogeneity into components due to ancestry and residual variation, which would be expected to improve fine-mapping resolution.
