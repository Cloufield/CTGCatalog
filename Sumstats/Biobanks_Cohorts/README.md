 - DESCRIPTION : Genomic studies in African populations provide unique opportunities to understand disease aetiology, human genetic diversity and population history in a regional and a global context. To leverage the relative benefits of different strategies, we undertook a combined approach of genotyping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a population-based study of 6,400 individuals from a geographically defined rural community in South-West Uganda. We present data from 4,778 individuals with genotypes for ~2.2 million SNPs from the Uganda GWAS resource (UGWAS), and sequence data on up to 1,978 individuals spanning 41.5M SNPs and 4.5M indels (UG2G); 343 individuals overlap between the two datasets. We highlight the value of the largest sequence panel from Africa to date as a global resource for variant discovery, imputation and understanding the mutational spectrum and its clinical relevance in African populations. Alongside phenotype data, we provide a rich new genomic resource for researchers in Africa and globally

These samples are then connected to clinical information, such as diseases or lab measures. These data are then used by researchers to discover new ways to detect, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure disease. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease. Other studies look at how genes affect response to medicines.

 - DESCRIPTION : In 2003, BioBank Japan (BBJ) started developing one of the world’s largest disease biobanks, creating a foundation for research aimed at achieving medical care tailored to the individual traits of each patient. From a total of 260,000 patients representing 440,000 cases of 51 primarily multifactorial (common) diseases, BBJ has collected DNA, serum, medical records (clinical information), etc. with their consent. No less than 5,800 items of screened information are available for research, including the patients’ survival information, with 95% of the patients tracked over an average of 10 years. In addition to large-scale genomic analyses, omics analyses including whole genome sequencing and metabolome/proteome analyses have been performed on the DNA, serum and other biological samples collected, producing significant research findings. The genomic information acquired through the analyses continues to be used as data. The biological samples and data are widely distributed and used by researchers.

 - URL : https://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland 
 - DESCRIPTION : Generation Scotland is a research study looking at the health and well-being of volunteers and their families. Generation Scotland combines responses to questionnaires of health and well-being from birth through life. We combine this with NHS health records and innovative laboratory science to understand health trajectories. We work closely with researchers and our volunteers to create a rich evidence base for understanding health. Through this rigorous, ethical and safe approach to research, we seek to enable meaningful change in public health.

 - URL : https://ibb.iarc.fr/ 
 - DESCRIPTION : The IARC BioBank (IBB) is one of the largest, most varied and richest International collections of samples in the world. The Biobank is publicly funded, (approximately 60% of its budget is provided by IARC Participating States through the regular budget and the remainder is from research grants) and hosts over 50 different studies, led or coordinated by IARC scientists. The IBB contains both population-based collections from research projects focusing on gene-environment interactions (as in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study) and disease-based collections which focus on biomarkers (as in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE)). Study designs include case-series, prevalence studies, case-control and cohort studies, etc. The IBB contains 5.1 million biological samples from 562,000 individuals. 4 million of the samples are from the EPIC study (over 370,000 individuals) and about one million samples from other collections (close to 200,000 individuals). Most of the samples are body fluids, including plasma, serum and urine as well as extracted DNA samples.
